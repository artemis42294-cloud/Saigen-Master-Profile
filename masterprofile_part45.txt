You realize this IS being done as an Awai extension, right?

Hiton is the Awai fusion that this references. ._.

			uh i thought about doing something like this, it basically gave chakra a black color, since black absorbs light you wouldn't be able to see inside the chakra.

minus the poop names, the only thing i can really think of is how is the darkness solid? Hiton, and by extension Meiton, isn't exactly a solid, i was under the impression that was something the Nara did, with things like Shadow Blade and such. other than that, I'd just like to see more of what this is capable of, so far it's just a light switch and a few shuriken techniques, but what you have so far seems good.

Awia are a clan that was originally a part of the Nara clan;

Anyway I can't see any real reason this would be denied though it does make it cooler in that it interacts with elements other than hiton.

			Most "light" that is created by any means isn't...Dark?

Like, it can be made to look "dark" by putting a filter over it, such as an LED having a dark blue casing that makes the light cast from it appear to be "dark", but the light itself is still bright.

			I really wish we could've gone another 6 months without someone trying to go British Imperialist on this subject so I could come up with a better solution, but thus far my best suggestion is dismantling the f3ck out of the Awai. Not that I'm saying we should, only that it's overreaching its bounds by a large enough stretch that I could trim some fat and there'd still be a clan left over.

The Nara are very, very relevant, Si. The Awai clan split off from the Nara because back in the day someone thought it'd be cute to have an angellic looking Konoha nin and the needed an excuse. And while the Awai do mostly hard constructs, their element is LIGHT. Yes, I realize that scientifically there is no such thing as darkness, only an absence of light, and as Jesse pointed out, your bloodline covers the absence of light. But if you're going to argue that you're entitled to darkness because it's the absence of light, then I'm going to have to point out that the absence of something has no physical presence.

You can't make a wall of nothing. It makes no sense. Yes, you SHOULD be able to make hard constructs with some inky black thing and call it darkness, but not on the grounds that you're doing it with an Awai.

I would point out that the largest and most persistent gripe I have with the Heat clan and Awai monopoly on bright lights is their lack of foundation in both logic and human ingenuity; control over a single thematic element may mean you can create the conditions for its absence, but it doesn't mean you can control those conditions as well. The Awai can control light. It doesn't make them the only ones who can make it. The heat clan controls heat. It doesn't make them the only ones who can use a mythological energy source (i.e. chakra) to create conditions that remove heat from the surrounding area without using ice.

Yes, I realize there's a slippery slope argument coming, that with that logic standard ninpou can do anything. But it's pretty clear that being a ninja lightbulb doesn't make you a ninja shadow bender when you turn yourself off. Doton users can't branch out into crystal release any more than a Kouton user could pull a Magneto and bloodbend with the iron in your blood. There is a fundamental difference between having a power and controlling its source. Ability slots are the former.

I like darkness as an element, it's a basic fantasy archetype and one that deserves to be done right. This isn't the way to do it right.

I really wish we could've gone another 6 months without someone trying to go British Imperialist on this subject so I could come up with a better solution, but thus far my best suggestion is dismantling the f3ck out of the Awai. Not that I'm saying we should, only that it's overreaching its bounds by a large enough stretch that I could trim some fat and there'd still be a clan left over.

The Nara are very, very relevant, Si. The Awai clan split off from the Nara because back in the day someone thought it'd be cute to have an angellic looking Konoha nin and the needed an excuse. And while the Awai do mostly hard constructs, their element is LIGHT. Yes, I realize that scientifically there is no such thing as darkness, only an absence of light, and as Jesse pointed out, your bloodline covers the absence of light. But if you're going to argue that you're entitled to darkness because it's the absence of light, then I'm going to have to point out that the absence of something has no physical presence.

You can't make a wall of nothing. It makes no sense. Yes, you SHOULD be able to make hard constructs with some inky black thing and call it darkness, but not on the grounds that you're doing it with an Awai.

I would point out that the largest and most persistent gripe I have with the Heat clan and Awai monopoly on bright lights is their lack of foundation in both logic and human ingenuity; control over a single thematic element may mean you can create the conditions for its absence, but it doesn't mean you can control those conditions as well. The Awai can control light. It doesn't make them the only ones who can make it. The heat clan controls heat. It doesn't make them the only ones who can use a mythological energy source (i.e. chakra) to create conditions that remove heat from the surrounding area without using ice.

Yes, I realize there's a slippery slope argument coming, that with that logic standard ninpou can do anything. But it's pretty clear that being a ninja lightbulb doesn't make you a ninja shadow bender when you turn yourself off. Doton users can't branch out into crystal release any more than a Kouton user could pull a Magneto and bloodbend with the iron in your blood. There is a fundamental difference between having a power and controlling its source. Ability slots are the former.

I like darkness as an element, it's a basic fantasy archetype and one that deserves to be done right. This isn't the way to do it right.

			It was a bright and early morning in the Land of Fire, the sun just breaking over the large treeline of the training grounds that Tenchu was currently at. He was doing what he always did: hammering into his training. Tenchu was always an early riser, up and out the door before sunrise every morning. The sound of his blows against a training dummy could be heard ringing out to anyone within a good range, as Tenchu punched and kicked the dummy until it was nothing but broken wood and stuffing. [color=#5a70b3][i]"No good... Training dummies are all but useless to me now. I need a real challenge, perhaps a spar..."[/i][/color] Tenchu loved to spar with people, he felt it was the best way to get to know someone as your true personality would show from how you fought. Win or lose, all he wanted was someone to practice against, someone that could handle his blows and deliver some of their own.

Tenchu sat on the ground and began meditating to clear his mind. Perhaps someone would join him in the training grounds sometime soon, as the sun was now up and he could see in the distance that people were beginning their hustle and bustle in the village.

			Akki was ready for a long day of training. He had recently just been given a secret unlike any other and was not ready to yet explore into it. He knew that he would have to get stronger in order to tame such a creature as he walked calmly through the village training grounds, catching glimpse of another ninja training against what seemed to be a dummy. No ordinarily, Akki wouldn't really care to help the boy, but the circumstances were different and he needed to be stronger as he walked up.

[b]"Looks like you got no one to train with."[/b] he would speak with a smile as an uneasy feeling started to creep up through his stomach, his hand grasping it somewhat tightly. [b]"I'm trying to get a lot stronger, and I thought it would benefit us both if we had a little bit of a fight."[/b] he would speak once more.

			Tenchu rose from the ground when he heard a male voice from behind him. As he checked to see who it was, he found a black haired boy about the same size as him. Of course, this observation came second to the fact that he had some weird masses coming from behind his ears and what looked to be two tails. [color=#5a70b3]"Uhh, are you okay? you seem to have... growths of some sort."[/color] Tenchu wasn't one to beat around the bush, if something was strange to him he would harshly point it out. [color=#5a70b3]Uh, that aside however, sure, I was just thinking that I needed a partner to train with, these dummies don't put up much of a fight."[/color] Tenchu said as he pointed to the dummy he had pulverized.

[color=#5a70b3]"Why don't you go first, I'd love to see what you're capable of."[/color] Tenchu's face changed to a serious expression as he took a battle ready stance and motioned for his current sparring partner to come at him.

			[b]"Well I can't really explain it myself but let's get started instead."[/b] Akki would speak with a smile as he quickly took a stance before charging in toward his new found opponent. The aim of today would rely all on akki's ability to change his strength into something that would be more formidable to other people. The only way he was going to do that is by getting a few good punches and kicks in as his feet would move, one step after the other.

[i]I have my speed down but I really need strength to match.[/i] he would think to himself before bending his right knee and jumping up at his opponent with a side kick. The kick would aim for the stomach of his opponent, to see what it was that his opponent was really able to take in as well as dish out back. [i]Nothing like finding out if this is a quick waste of time or might prove to be something better.[/i] he would continue to think.

If the kick were to not become successful, Akki would use his hands to push off of the ground and flip backwards back onto his two feet. He mained in the art of Taijutsu and was quick and pretty agile for his age and ninja class.

			Tenchu was ready for whatever attack his new found partner decided to throw at him. He had been practicing a counter that was aimed at throwing someone off balance by taking the brunt of an enemies strike on their arm. This was what he intended for his new partner, and the reason why he wanted him to go first. The boy flew at him, quicker than he had anticipated, and went to snap kick him in the stomach, leaping into the air. [color=#5a70b3][i]"Now!"[/i][/color] Tenchu thought as his right arm took the blow, feeling a bit of pressure, but not much pain, as the kick had great form but lacked power. Tenchu's arms then went upwards, crossing at the wrist, using his right elbow in an attempt to throw the boy off balance by bringing his leg up with his arm. To finish the attempt, he took a step forward on his left foot while attempting to bring down his left arm onto the boy's shoulder or head, ending in a sideways position to the boy. However, He had evaded his strike by essentially falling onto the ground and hand springing back to his feet. [color=#5a70b3]"Your pretty agile, I like that. You need some more strength behind your strikes though, that kick had good form, but was overall pretty weak."[/color] Being up front about things like that are what made someone stronger, so Tenchu had no problem pointing out the boy's flaws so that he might improve upon them. [color=#5a70b3]"So now what, is it my turn?"[/color]

OOC: 255/800 words for counter move.

[color=#5a70b3][i]"Now!"[/i][/color] Tenchu thought as his right arm took the blow, feeling a bit of pressure, but not much pain, as the kick had great form but lacked power. Tenchu's arms then went upwards, crossing at the wrist, using his right elbow in an attempt to throw the boy off balance by bringing his leg up with his arm. To finish the attempt, he took a step forward on his left foot while attempting to bring down his left arm onto the boy's shoulder or head, ending in a sideways position to the boy. However, He had evaded his strike by essentially falling onto the ground and hand springing back to his feet. [color=#5a70b3]"Your pretty agile, I like that. You need some more strength behind your strikes though, that kick had good form, but was overall pretty weak."[/color] Being up front about things like that are what made someone stronger, so Tenchu had no problem pointing out the boy's flaws so that he might improve upon them. [color=#5a70b3]"So now what, is it my turn?"[/color]

OOC: 255/800 words for counter move.

			His opponent was very blunt with the critique about Akki's lack of strength within his attacks. [i]He just pointed out the obvious, but I guess that only means that I am going to have to come in even stronger.[/i] he would start to think to himself as he balanced out onto his feet, thinking back on the type of counter that was being used against him. [i]He tried to grab a hold of my body and either attack or throw me down... Not really sure, but I know I gotta be careful.[/i] he would continue to think before stretching out his right leg a bit.

[b]"You know, counters are always good to have under pocket, but maybe you should keep a better footing and place your hands in a better position so that your opponent won't escape."[/b] he would speak before speeding toward his sparring partner once more.

One step after another he would run forward, arms behind him as his body would leap into the air. [i]Momentum will bring strength.[/i] a quick though would cross his mind as he performed a straight kick toward his opponent. Luckily for the Jinchuuriki, he had trained in different styles of Taijutsu and using the high style was surely one that would help both his speed and strength.

The kick would aim, just about near the right shoulder of his sparring partner, and if his opponent was able to dodge or even block, he would try to use his right leg (the other one) to pull back and try to kick his opponent once more. The goal, to just force power into his attacks.

*[High Kick]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

This simple technique begins with the user approaching the opponent and leaping soon before overlapping. The moment the legs come off of the ground, one of the user's legs will stretch straight out to form a simple flying kick. Because the user of this technique is suddenly at a higher position in the air, this attack may surprise the opponent and go past his/her defenses.

			Tenchu again readied himself for the assault his sparring partner was about to dish out, as the genin darted towards him. Apparently the boy thought he was attempting a grapple, when in reality the move in question was a simple hammer fist style counter, aimed at the opponents shoulder or head to knock them to the ground. He did however take the boy's advice to heart, and plant his feet more firmly to the ground. The boy leapt from the ground and performed a straight kick into his shoulder, which Tench allowed to hit, feeling the force on his shoulder as the pain began coursing through his arm. This of course was intentional, as he intended to counter the next attack. As the second kick came in, he blocked the blow with his left elbow, and once more, bringing his arms and his opponents leg above his head. Then, taking a swift step forward on his right leg and putting his right side to the boy, he brought his right arm down in a hammerfist aimed at his opponent's left shoulder. Whether the counter hit or not mattered little, Tenchu's form was flawless, but he lacked his full strength on this maneuver. He still wasn't satisfied with the result, and his right arm was in a good amount of pain.

-----------------Training end------------------

Tenchu backed up a bit, and dropped his stance. [color=#5a70b3]"That kick was a lot better, my arm is still in pain from the blow. I still don't feel good about that counter though, I can do better. Okay, what next?"[/color]

OOC: 462/800 for strong fist Counter attack.

			His kicks were becoming more and more of a success as he could feel the force through the expressions from his training partner. This was by far one of the greatest feelings in the world for Akki to know that he was actually getting better at certain things as the next set of moves by his sparring partner would seem to catch him off guard, not to mention that the uneasy feeling in his stomach was once more coming back to him.

[i]Now is not the time.[/i] he would think to himself as the presence of the Genma would overtake his mind, the current actions of being countered and punched to the ground now as if everything slowed in time. [i]Why do you keep trying to fight your way out of my body?[/i] he would continue to think as a fist would meet directly at his shoulder hitting him toward the ground as he fell back before rolling off of his back and back up onto his two feet. It was not as agile as any other recovery would have been but he managed to stagger to his feet after a strong blow.

[b]"Was not expecting that kind of counter."[/b] Akki would chuckle with a smile as he realized that his partner was already perfecting his owns sets of skills. [i]Time for my strength to conquer more as well![/i] he would think to himself before looking up at his opponent and speaking, [b]"Get ready. This time I'm not gonna hold back and you'll get the full force of my new found strength."[/b] he would speak with a smile before stretching his leg out once more and using full speed to run forward.

[i]Just gotta push through the pain and into the glory![/i] he would think to himself as he would quickly leap forward with a somersault, followed by a kick onto the shoulder, aiming to hit down with his right leg, before jumping right back off in a back flip and running forward with a series of small jabs to both arms and over the stomach.

At first sight and feel, the jabs were nothing more but annoying pokes, but if Akki was successfully able to get more than four off, the strength from them would increase as the muscles and his joints would contract and react to fulfill the goal it was that he had in mind. The goal to become a stronger shinobi of the hidden leaf. After all, the jinchuuriki of the Siphon Genma should have no less of a requirement than to be the best of the best.

Whether or not akki would be countered or whether he would just back off from his pure onslaught of attacks, he would sit back and take a breather before looking up at his opponent for what seemed to be a bit of approval. The only way to know that he was actually doing better and becoming stronger would be if Tenchu were to tell him. It was as iff Akki did not even need words but used the curious stare he gave at the ninja instead.

			Tenchu still wanted to work on perfecting his counterattack, and it seemed his partner was still raring to go at it. Tenchu once more took a battle ready stance, with his legs spread a bit for better balance, left arm by his hip, and right elbow curved back with his hand by his face, in the form of a straight punch. The boy came at him with incredible speed, but Tenchu still tried to catch him with the counter attack, As he tried to block an oncoming kick with his arm, to once more lift his leg up and bring his arm down onto the boy's shoulder, but this time with more power, as he knew he was capable of a stronger blow than the last one. Tenchu's attack had missed completely however, as the boy flipped and delivered a strong heel drop onto his shoulder, causing intense pain in his arm once more. [color=#5a70b3]"I've never seen a style like this, he's in the air doing some of the fastest flips i've ever seen."[/color]

He had to take a step back from the genin to regain his composure, as his right arm was almost limp at this point, exhausted from the two powerful hits he had already taken. [color=#5a70b3][i]"Oh man, this kid is a bit stronger than i thought, my arm is killing me. I just need to find an opening to get him off of me."[/i][/color] He had barely enough time to shake his arm out as Akki was again on him, stepping forward with a series of light jabs aiming at Tenchu's midsection. Tenchu blocked a good amount of them with his arms, but as his right arm had already taken so much he couldn't use it much more, and he took a few to his stomach and chest as well. He took a series of steps back from the genin's assault, watching his every step. Finally, he noticed the boy took a wide step forward to continue attacking him. [color=#5a70b3][i]"Now!"[/i][/color] Tenchu thought to himself as he blocked a right jab with his left elbow, almost like a parry, bringing the arm up with his elbow as he stepped forward and brought his left arm onto the boy once more, in one of Tenchu's strongest blows. The counter was flawless this time, and whether it hit or not, the boy's onslaught was complete. Tenchu relaxed his arm a bit and checked for damages to his shoulder before meeting eyes with Akki, seeing that he wanted input on the damage he had caused him.

-------Training end------------------

[color=#5a70b3]"That was much better, your second kick to my shoulder caused it to go limp for a good while, and the jabs to my stomach began hurting after the third strike. Keep working on it your strength if you aim to be a fighter though, your form and speed is incredible, but I still have a bit more muscle."[/color] Tenchu wasn't normally one to brag, but in this scenario he just wanted to get the point across that strength is the driving point of damage when it came to fist fighting.

[color=#5a70b3][i]"Now!"[/i][/color] Tenchu thought to himself as he blocked a right jab with his left elbow, almost like a parry, bringing the arm up with his elbow as he stepped forward and brought his left arm onto the boy once more, in one of Tenchu's strongest blows. The counter was flawless this time, and whether it hit or not, the boy's onslaught was complete. Tenchu relaxed his arm a bit and checked for damages to his shoulder before meeting eyes with Akki, seeing that he wanted input on the damage he had caused him.

-------Training end------------------

[color=#5a70b3]"That was much better, your second kick to my shoulder caused it to go limp for a good while, and the jabs to my stomach began hurting after the third strike. Keep working on it your strength if you aim to be a fighter though, your form and speed is incredible, but I still have a bit more muscle."[/color] Tenchu wasn't normally one to brag, but in this scenario he just wanted to get the point across that strength is the driving point of damage when it came to fist fighting.

OOC: 875/800 words for strong fist counterattack

			Akki was done getting ruffed a bit for the day and was surely enjoying the new found strength that came with his new found training.

[b]"Well then, that was enough for today I believe. If you want we can pick up again tomorrow on some more new tricks and trainings."[/b] he would speak before fixing his clothing and walking out toward the exit. [b]"Dawn okay?"[/b]

I'll see you then."[/color] And with that, Tenchu began going about the rest of his day. It wasn't until he was long gone that he realized he never caught the boy's name, but honestly, it didn't matter. He could fight, and that was enough for him.

[b]Change:[/b] please add the following Jutsu to their respective Spoilers.
IaidoShow [color=#8B658B]*Iaido • Clash Draw[/color]

D-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 4 Speed

In this technique, the user assumes a firm stance and then draws their weapon in an upward arc. This sort of draw makes it easy to bat away projectiles moving at a Speed and Strength equal to or lower than the user's Speed and Strength. This also enables the user to cut through advancing techniques or to clash with an opponent's weapon. This movement, however, may leave the user without the ability to sheath his weapon for some time, limiting the effectiveness of their techniques until they can.

[color=#8B658B]*Iaido • Snap Draw[/color]

C-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 6 Taijutsu, 6 Speed

With a honed body capable of producing torque within the user's muscles, the user is capable of achieving a 'Blurred Sword' effect in an attack. The user draws their sword with such speed and power, the strike itself goes undetected by opponents lacking Taijutsu greater than a third of the user's Taijutsu stat. While essentially similar to the basic Iaido technique this one is literally beyond the normal capability of the user and as such, it can only be used a number of times per thread equal to the user's stamina and taijutsu divided by 2.

[color=#8B658B]*Iaido • Reverse Beheading Draw[/color]

B-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: Iaido • Beheading Draw

By building tension in two places in their body, the user unleashes a spin and then draws their katana in a swift motion without pause until returning to face their original direction, sword sheathing in the process. The attack has incredible destructive power, though lacks the visual blur in speed. The attack is still fast enough, however, to disorient opponents greatly.
TaijutsuShow [b]*Skillful Wield[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: 3 wit

With a solid foundation of knowledge on their choice of weaponry, those with the Skillful Wield technique are able to utilize their weapon more fully. By knowing the weapon's weakest points, the user is able to avoid presenting these areas to damage during combat, thus making their weapon less likely to break by means of recklessness.

[b]*Seamless Skill[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: 3 wit

A skill utilized by those on the path to mastery of their weapon, users of Seamless Skill are actively able to transition between offensive and defensive usage of the aforementioned weapon. By transitioning so seamlessly, the user is able to save a marginal amount of energy while attacking.
Chiton EmpathyShow [color=#DC143C]Affinity Pulse[/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Singled Out

After having located an individual through the use of the Singled Out technique, the user will focus on the individual in question and be able to determine what elemental affinities the individual has. This only works for elements that the user has seen before, normally being limited to those represented in Kirigakure no Sato until he is able to read and learn about others.
ChitonShow [color=#DC143C]Sanguine Reach[/color]

A-rank Ninjutsu

Utilizing a large preexisting blood source while weilding his sword, Ryoga begins performing a string of one handed seals. After finishing the final seal, A 20 meter long arm of blood emerges from the source. The arm is 1.5 meters in diameter, And it holds a 10 meter long sharpened sword of blood. As long as Ryoga holds the final seal, the arm mimics his sword arms movements, moving with a speed equal to his control to a max of 12, and hitting with a strength equal to the average of his Ninjutsu and Control, to a max of of 10. He can manifest this arm up to 15 meters away from his body, but once the arm is made it is set in that area. Ryoga is immobile as long as he holds this jutsu, save for his sword arm. Any break in his concentration ends the jutsu immediately

A-rank Ninjutsu

Utilizing a large preexisting blood source while weilding his sword, Ryoga begins performing a string of one handed seals. After finishing the final seal, A 20 meter long arm of blood emerges from the source. The arm is 1.5 meters in diameter, And it holds a 10 meter long sharpened sword of blood. As long as Ryoga holds the final seal, the arm mimics his sword arms movements, moving with a speed equal to his control to a max of 12, and hitting with a strength equal to the average of his Ninjutsu and Control, to a max of of 10. He can manifest this arm up to 15 meters away from his body, but once the arm is made it is set in that area. Ryoga is immobile as long as he holds this jutsu, save for his sword arm. Any break in his concentration ends the jutsu immediately

			The trainings are fine but because they weren't really training 'together' it might not count towards the event. The point of social training is to train together. Not separately side by side. It should be give and take between the parties.

[/quote]Needs to mention that while using it Ryoga cannot move aside from his arm and if his concentration is broken the jutsu fades. He also needs to describe if the blood sword is sharp or not.

			Ryoga was in an uproar at his superiors today. [color=#DC143C]"Why should I teach my signature sensory capabilities to someone else!?[/color] It was obvious that he wasn't happy with the situation, but unfortunately, he was a loyal ninja of Kirigakure, and would begrudgingly do what was asked of him. He had sent a letter to the jounin known as Takeshi Muramasa's house telling him to meet Ryoga at the training ground he had picked out. Deep in a misty forest, following a river, there was a clearing with a stream flowing through the middle, about 50 meters in diameter. This was the area Ryoga picked for their training exercises. If nothing else he could probably practice some chiton of his own, he still had some work to do on the easier techniques. But everyone had to start somewhere.

Ryoga sat in a tree, using the very sensing abilities he was to teach to Takeshi to locate him long before he reached the clearing. He probably wouldn't act on anything, for now he just wanted to know that he was coming. He would hold this jutsu until he felt his pulse.

			Today had been designated for Takeshi to begin his sensory training. He himself would have rather learned on his own if he could, but it had been suggested and then even ordered that he would be taught by someone with similar techniques to his own. And so Takeshi found himself travelling towards a training grounds which had been designated to him via a letter from whom he supposed would be his mentor. The spot was not too hard to get to and when he arrived he saw no one else waiting for him. Either he was early, they were late, or they were hiding. He made himself comfortable by the stream while he waited.

			Ryoga noticed the Jounin the moment he was within the 30 meter range of his technique. He proceeded to single him out, focusing specifically on him and him alone. He was high enough in a tree that he probably wouldn't see him immediately, if at all, but Ryoga's chiton sensing was pretty accurate, as he watched the man go and wait by the stream. Ryoga quickly leapt towards the stream, landing about 10 feet away from Takeshi. [color=#DC143C]"So, your the jounin that i've been instructed to teach Chiton Empathy to? I hope you have the ability to control it."[/color] There was a hint of displeasure in Ryoga's voice, but it wasn't directly aimed at Takeshi, more towards his superiors who felt that this man learning how to sense was important enough to make Ryoga practically give away his personal sensory capabilities. [color=#DC143C]"I'm Ryoga Kazuki. Is there anything that you need to do to prepare yourself, or can we just get started?"[/color]

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Control 6

After doing the needed hand seals, the user channels their chakra into the surrounding area, travelling at a speed equal to the user's control, up to 30 yards away. This allows the user to sense nearby blood pulses. At this level, it doesn't allow for pinpoint movements, but it does allow for the user to sense direction and distance.

			Takeshi could feel the pulse of chiton chakra as it touched his body. An odd sensation. After listening to Ryoga's instruction, Takeshi nodded in acknowledgement. Takeshi was not entirely sure how to begin. He knew only the very basics of chakra control and manipulation. He stood there in silence for a moment or so, thinking of what to do. Most of his techniques involved manipulating blood through chiton chakra, not sending raw chiton chakra through the air. Takeshi placed his hands in front of him, willing his chakra to gather there. A buildup of chiton chakra accumulated into a blob. Takeshi got too far ahead of himself and tried to fire it off immediately. It did anything but what it was supposed to. As it left his hands the chiton chakra completely lost its shape. The blob became gaseous and dissipated into the air. [color=#DC143C][b]"Too soon, I suppose."[/b][/color]

Placing his hands back in front of himself, Takeshi once more began to amass a buildup of chiton chakra. He more carefully shaped it this time, forming it into a more perfect sphere. A sphere was not a pulse though and so Takeshi knew he was not yet done. Concentrating even more, he asserted his will to form the chakra into the shape of a disc. A hole began to appear in the sphere as it spread outwards and became a ring. Takeshi pushed his chakra outwards in an attempt to send the ring of chiton into the near distance. It didn't get very far at all. In fact, it only got about two feet from his hands before it collapsed in on itself and dissipated like the previous attempt.

Takeshi was struggling. He was not sure what it was he was doing wrong. He thought back to just a few moments ago, when Ryoga had performed a demonstration for him. Ryoga's pulse was more solid, without the hole in the middle. That had to be it. Takeshi placed his hands in front of him and sent another surge of chiton chakra. This time he more easily shaped it into a sphere. Instead of turning it into a ring though, Takeshi attempted to turn it into a flat disc, mustering his might to keep the chakra in the correct shape. He did not relax his grip in the slightest as he eventually formed the chakra into the desired shape. He held it for a moment or so before sending it forwards from his body. It traveled a ways further than the previous attempts, but it too dissipated after going only roughly four yards.

He looked towards Ryoga. [color=#DC143C][b]"Any suggestions?"[/b][/color]

			Ryoga watched patiently as the jounin began trying to form a pulse of chiton chakra. He didn't expect him to succeed on the first few attempts as chiton was not usually utilized in this manner. As Takeshi formed the ball of chiton and released it in a pulse, albeit a weak one that barely went a few yards, he was honestly quite impressed. [color=#DC143C][i]"Maybe he has some potential."[/i][/color] Takeshi had finished his pulse, but Ryoga didn't think he was quite good enough yet, perhaps another exercise was in order. [color=#DC143C]"Alright, this is an exercise that I do whenever I try to make new sensing techniques. Take a good amount of blood, around a pint or so, and practice forming it into a perfect sphere. Once you get a grasp on maintaining that sphere, we can practice molding it into something to give you a feel for controlling the blood and sending it into the air. That's the basics of chiton empathy sensing."[/color] Ryoga wouldn't demonstrate this technique, as he didn't want to slice into himself just yet, plus it was easier for the Jounin to try it himself. He stood patiently waiting to see how well Takeshi maintained control of his chakra.

			Takeshi listened intently to Ryoga's instructions. He nodded in acknowledgement and took a few steps back. He began to remove his shirt, revealing his arrangement of crimson tattoos. He lazily tossed his shirt over to his right side, watching as it fell to the ground in a crumbled heap. Takeshi performed a set of hand seals and brough his right hand to the end of the tiger tattoo on his left hand. Almost instantaneously, a gallon of blood flew forth from the tattoo on Takeshi's arm. As the blood fell to the ground, the tattoo on his left arm turned from red to black. Takeshi noted to himself that it now only contained half the amount of blood it was capable of holding.

Sitting himself cross-legged in front of the small pool of blood, Takeshi inhaled deeply before letting it back out. He reached out with is right arm, his palm facing towards the blood before him. He closed his eyes and began to amass a bit of chiton chakra into his hand. It began to surge between his hand and the blood. The pool of blood began to rise up and float just off the ground. It was definitely more than a pint, he had accidentally moved the entire gallon. In a split moment of frustration over his own carelessness, Takeshi's grip on the pool weakened and the whole gallon dropped to the ground. He breathed in deeply again.

Exhale. Takeshi calmed his nerves after a few deep breathes, and tried again. This time he was exceptionally more careful about it. He sent the chiton chakra into a pint or so of the blood before him. It lifted up from the ground, and became level with his chest. Takeshi had trouble getting it into form into a sphere however, the blood instead forming into a glob with some lumpy protrusions. He concentrated even harder, willing his chakra to control and shape the blood floating before him. Slowly, it began to condense itself tighter together. It still was not exactly a sphere though. While he had succeeded in removing the lumps, he had failed to get the shape he needed. The blood before him had been shaped into a prolate spheroid. It was too tall and rather skinny.

He continued to attempt to shape the blood through the use of chiton chakra. He applied more chakra to blood, pushing the top and bottom of the shape in an attempt to make it more sphere-like. It worked, or so it did at first. The orb was a sphere for only a moment, before becoming squished. It had become an oblate spheroid. It was too wide and not tall enough. Inhaling deeply while maintaining the current shape, Takeshi took a moment to pause before exhaling. Now he let up on some of the chakra he used to push on the top and bottom of the spheroid, attempting to even it back out into the the desired shape he had seen only just a moment ago.

Success! For now, Takeshi had managed to manipulate and shape the pint of blood into a nearly flawless sphere. He was not having all that much trouble maintaining the shape itself afterwards, but rather had to keep it from falling to the ground. He pushed more chakra into the bottom of the sphere, raising it up to his eye level. While he did so, he pushed a relatively small amount of chakra onto the rest of the surface of the sphere, so as not to break the shape. As far as he could tell, he had made a bit of progress.

He looked towards Ryoga.

Takeshi listened intently to Ryoga's instructions. He nodded in acknowledgement and took a few steps back. He began to remove his shirt, revealing his arrangement of crimson tattoos. He lazily tossed his shirt over to his right side, watching as it fell to the ground in a crumbled heap. Takeshi performed a set of hand seals and brough his right hand to the end of the tiger tattoo on his left hand. Almost instantaneously, a gallon of blood flew forth from the tattoo on Takeshi's arm. As the blood fell to the ground, the tattoo on his left arm turned from red to black. Takeshi noted to himself that it now only contained half the amount of blood it was capable of holding.

Sitting himself cross-legged in front of the small pool of blood, Takeshi inhaled deeply before letting it back out. He reached out with is right arm, his palm facing towards the blood before him. He closed his eyes and began to amass a bit of chiton chakra into his hand. It began to surge between his hand and the blood. The pool of blood began to rise up and float just off the ground. It was definitely more than a pint, he had accidentally moved the entire gallon. In a split moment of frustration over his own carelessness, Takeshi's grip on the pool weakened and the whole gallon dropped to the ground. He breathed in deeply again.

Exhale. Takeshi calmed his nerves after a few deep breathes, and tried again. This time he was exceptionally more careful about it. He sent the chiton chakra into a pint or so of the blood before him. It lifted up from the ground, and became level with his chest. Takeshi had trouble getting it into form into a sphere however, the blood instead forming into a glob with some lumpy protrusions. He concentrated even harder, willing his chakra to control and shape the blood floating before him. Slowly, it began to condense itself tighter together. It still was not exactly a sphere though. While he had succeeded in removing the lumps, he had failed to get the shape he needed. The blood before him had been shaped into a prolate spheroid. It was too tall and rather skinny.

He continued to attempt to shape the blood through the use of chiton chakra. He applied more chakra to blood, pushing the top and bottom of the shape in an attempt to make it more sphere-like. It worked, or so it did at first. The orb was a sphere for only a moment, before becoming squished. It had become an oblate spheroid. It was too wide and not tall enough. Inhaling deeply while maintaining the current shape, Takeshi took a moment to pause before exhaling. Now he let up on some of the chakra he used to push on the top and bottom of the spheroid, attempting to even it back out into the the desired shape he had seen only just a moment ago.

Success! For now, Takeshi had managed to manipulate and shape the pint of blood into a nearly flawless sphere. He was not having all that much trouble maintaining the shape itself afterwards, but rather had to keep it from falling to the ground. He pushed more chakra into the bottom of the sphere, raising it up to his eye level. While he did so, he pushed a relatively small amount of chakra onto the rest of the surface of the sphere, so as not to break the shape. As far as he could tell, he had made a bit of progress.

He looked towards Ryoga.

608 towards control

			Ryoga watched silently as Takeshi attempted to do the exercise he had told him about, though he was slightly caught off guard by his strange tattoo of blood. Taking it for a Fuuin tattoo, he thought nothing of it, and continued to watch him fail time and again at regulating his control over blood. It wasn't an easy exercise to perform, but Ryoga had never had an issue performing it, and expected better of this man if he was to take on his empathy style. [color=#DC143C]"You can do better than that, regulate your chakra, form the overall shape and go from there."[/color] Ryoga then saw that his student had gotten the hang of the exercise, as a perfectly shaped orb of blood now floated in front of his face, which was now staring at him as Takeshi awaited his next instruction.

[color=#DC143C]"Alright, alright, you did okay. You can drop that orb now Takeshi. Perhaps you aren't as weak willed as I initially thought. But this is still going to be difficult for you to perform, even with your newfound control. We'll start with the basic location jutsu, Feel the Pulse."[/color] Ryoga took a deep breath and began performing his hand seals, bringing forth a large amount of chiton chakra. Once more, Takeshi would watch as the pulse of Chiton left Ryoga's body and washed over him, feeling the blood pulse within his body before returning to Ryoga. [color=#DC143C]"I just utilized the chiton chakra within me to send out a wave of chakra, which begins searching for something with a pulse. Once that wave washed over you, I felt your pulse and knew generally where you were. This basic technique is effective up to 30 yards, but of course as you get better you can make better versions yourself. Now, do what I did, and send a wave of chiton towards me. Use it to feel my pulse."[/color] With Ryoga's long instruction now complete, he took a seat by a nearby tree to give Takeshi some peace and quiet, and watched as his student practiced searching for him.

Jutsu usedShow Feel the Pulse

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Control 6

After doing the needed hand seals, the user channels their chakra into the surrounding area, travelling at a speed equal to the user's control, up to 30 yards away. This allows the user to sense nearby blood pulses. At this level, it doesn't allow for pinpoint movements, but it does allow for the user to sense direction and distance.

			The new day's sun rose over the hazy clouds that sheltered the Village Hidden in the Mist. Today was to be the first time that Tadataka would training with a fellow Jounin. Considering he was the younger of the two; Tadataka was allowed to choose the spot where they were to meet--for they had never met before. Tadataka was the most recently promoted Jounin within the Village Hidden in the Mist, and as such, he was paired to train with a veteran Missing Ninja hunter in order to further along his skills. It was hoped; that he too would pass along a different perspective to the one known as Kazuki Ryoga.

Breakfast had come and passed by the time Tadataka had arrived at a swath of forest that he had determined would make a fine training ground. It had a stream running through the middle of a medium-sized clearing that was surrounded by a wall of trees. Tadataka figured that this area would give enough room for the two to practice--while at the same time not be too large that the space wouldn't be taken proper advantage of. For now, however, Tadataka would wait in the center of the clearing for his new training partner--left to imagine what might take place when they begun to show their abilities to learn.

			[color=#DC143C]"Ugh."[/color] Was the only thing Ryoga was able to force out of himself as he walked along the path to the training area picked out by this "Tadataka" person he was to meet today. It seemed any time Ryoga was given orders to meet someone new, it ended in disaster, as could be seen by his new "partner" Kirio. Yet again, Ryoga was given instructions by his superiors to meet with a specific jounin today. It didn't help that the Jounin in question had recently been promoted, causing Ryoga to already feel as though he were a bit beneath him.

As he trekked into the forest, following the paths deeper in, he began to hear a stream trickling by. No sooner had he took notice of this stream, the trees suddenly opened up into a clearing surrounded by a thick wall of trees. Ryoga quickly surveyed the area, taking note of the stream travelling through the middle of the clearing, and more importantly, who he assumed was the Jounin in question. As Ryoga approached the man, he took note of the wakizashi on his back, and the scars running up his right hand, taking him for a swordsman of sorts. When he was about 5 feet from the man, he would stop and introduce himself in about the only way he knew how. [color=#DC143C]"So, I assume it's you i'm supposed to be meeting today, Tadataka, is it? I'm Ryoga, I believe you already know, but I've been commanded to train with you, and I suppose assess your skills while also seeing what you could improve on. Is there anything you want to say before we get started? Anything in particular you want me to know?"[/color]

			"[b]I expected you to be... taller[/b]," Tadataka said as he began stretching his arms and legs--looking the man before him in the eye as he lowered himself to Ryoga's level. "[b]So, what shall we begin with? Taijutsu? Kenjutsu? Ninjutsu? Such a variety of options[/b]," He questioned as he rose back up to his full height. Tadataka was a good two inches taller than the older man that stood before him--not to mention he had about 50 pounds on him as well. Tadataka was more of a physical specimen than Ryoga, but it was obvious--with his advancement in years and experience--that Ryoga would be quicker and more likely to have better technique than Tadataka has. Perhaps he was poking the bear a little bit, but it seemed to Tadataka that perhaps the frank tone that he lended would be more to Ryoga's liking.

			Heh. Ryoga liked the tone this man was taking with him, it almost reminded him of himself honestly. The man seemed a bit more brutish than him though, as he easily had more muscle than he did, and as Tadataka pointed out he had a few inches on him. [color=#DC143C]"A quick draw of my sword could fix that really easily. You look a bit better than I thought you would, i'll admit, but unless you can properly wield that sword, I've still got quite a bit on you. In any case, word's are cheap, how about we get started with some basic taijutsu. I have a few thing i've been meaning to catch up on."[/color]

As Ryoga said this, He placed his right hand on his sword, ready to block whatever slashes Tadataka would throw at him. [color=#DC143C]"Now, let me see that sword arm, give me something to block."[/color] Ryoga would be prepared at this point to react to whatever the man did next.

			"[b]If you insist[/b]," Tadataka said as he reached to his back to grab the hilt of his Wakizashi and withdraw it from its sheathe. When it was fully drawn--as he brought it down in front of him--he spun it in the palm of his hand. Tadataka had good control of his weapon, but yet he did not have a style he could rely upon in an open confrontation. Perhaps Ryoga could show him a thing or two, but for now it was Tadataka's turn to show what he had--perhaps even gaining something for himself in the process. Maybe his gains would be a new taijutsu to add to his repertoire.

New JutsuShow[b]*Ambidexterity[/b]

D - Ranked Taijutsu

Requires: 5 Taijutsu

After extensive practice and training the character has gained equal strength and skill between their two hands. This allows them to perform any action with either hand at exactly the same skill level and strength.

He held his Wakizashi in front of himself in a one-handed grip before slowly moving his left hand to the grip as well. In that motion he brought his arms back to feign a stab at Ryoga, but instead he contorted his arms in a way to bring his blade across his body and then back down in an overhead slash at Ryoga from right to left (Ryoga's left to right). Usually he would wait for his opponent's reaction to his attack, but Ryoga had told him to give him something to block, and so he would. After the slash, Tadataka would release the hilt with his right hand, and in the continued motion he would sweep his left arm back enough to give enough space for Tadataka to reverse his hand (pointing the Wakizashi backwards) so that his palm would be facing the sky. With that motion completed, Tadataka would send a side slash from left to right (Ryoga's right to left) using his underdeveloped left hand.  After the second slash, following in the continued motion, Tadataka would then grab the hilt with his right hand--so now both hands were on the hilt--before pushing his body forwards in a lunging stab aimed at Ryoga's mid-section.

"[b]How's that[/b]," asked Tadataka in a strained tone. The blows that he had sent forth were not of the lightest variety, but he had a feeling that Ryoga would be unimpressed at his brute strength. It was a shame though, for Tadataka was also trying something new, for a first impression of skill it was likely that Ryoga would also be unimpressed with his technique--especially from the left-handed strike. Perhaps Tadataka would be able to improve on his off-hand to allow himself to be ambidextrous.

			Ryoga tensed up as Tadataka drew his wakizashi from it's hilt. From the moment he touched his blade he could immediately tell he had no sense of technique, though at least he had decent control of his weapon as he watched him spin it in the palm of his hand. Ryoga on the other hand, Having trained in Iaido since he was young, was easily fast enough to deal with whatever the man threw at him. But Ryoga was trying to better utilize his weapon for defense, he had an issue with using the wrong areas to block with his weapon, which could potentially break it. His exercise today would be to block Tadataka's powerful strikes without breaking his sword.

Tadataka was surprisingly fast for such a brutish looking man, As it appeared he would attempt to stab him. Ryoga let the blade get as close as possible, then as he was about to draw his blade and block, he realized the feint as the man brought the blade around in a circle, to come at left side of Ryoga's head. He had just made it even easier to block, as with a flash Ryoga drew his sword with his right hand straight up and out of his sheath, sword tip down, and blocked the strike to his head with the side of his blade, trying not to damage the slicing edge of his signature weapon. No sooner had he drawn his sword, Tadataka released his weapon and grabbed it with his left hand, to circle around and catch his other side. Normally Ryoga would have resheathed, but instead he pulled his sword completely out of his sheath, across his body to his right side, and once more blocked the base of his katana against the edge of the jounin's wakizashi. Ryoga felt his blade vibrate a bit with that strike, but the blade did not crack thankfully.

Ryoga watched once more as Tadataka switched sword hands and attempted another stab at his mid section. Ryoga's blade was already out, he wouldn't let this one get nearly as close. As the blade came in, Ryoga switched his stance to a dagger facing grip, sword pointed downward, and swung his arm horizontally from right to left, effectively redirecting the attack to his left, away from him completely.

Ryoga tensed up as Tadataka drew his wakizashi from it's hilt. From the moment he touched his blade he could immediately tell he had no sense of technique, though at least he had decent control of his weapon as he watched him spin it in the palm of his hand. Ryoga on the other hand, Having trained in Iaido since he was young, was easily fast enough to deal with whatever the man threw at him. But Ryoga was trying to better utilize his weapon for defense, he had an issue with using the wrong areas to block with his weapon, which could potentially break it. His exercise today would be to block Tadataka's powerful strikes without breaking his sword.

Tadataka was surprisingly fast for such a brutish looking man, As it appeared he would attempt to stab him. Ryoga let the blade get as close as possible, then as he was about to draw his blade and block, he realized the feint as the man brought the blade around in a circle, to come at left side of Ryoga's head. He had just made it even easier to block, as with a flash Ryoga drew his sword with his right hand straight up and out of his sheath, sword tip down, and blocked the strike to his head with the side of his blade, trying not to damage the slicing edge of his signature weapon. No sooner had he drawn his sword, Tadataka released his weapon and grabbed it with his left hand, to circle around and catch his other side. Normally Ryoga would have resheathed, but instead he pulled his sword completely out of his sheath, across his body to his right side, and once more blocked the base of his katana against the edge of the jounin's wakizashi. Ryoga felt his blade vibrate a bit with that strike, but the blade did not crack thankfully.

Ryoga watched once more as Tadataka switched sword hands and attempted another stab at his mid section. Ryoga's blade was already out, he wouldn't let this one get nearly as close. As the blade came in, Ryoga switched his stance to a dagger facing grip, sword pointed downward, and swung his arm horizontally from right to left, effectively redirecting the attack to his left, away from him completely. As Tadataka asked him how he did, Ryoga inspected his blade for any damage, and was relieved to find that it was completely safe. [color=#DC143C]"Well, luckily my blade isn't damaged.

			"[b]Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves. Eventually a kenjutsu style may be useful, but for now my strengths lie in stealth and deception. Why not try your hand at attacking me,[/b]" Tadataka inquired as he sheathed his Wakizashi before forming a few hand signs that finished with a puff of smoke and a Shadow Clone appearing next to him. It was then when both Tadataka, and his clone, drew their Wakizashi and held them in one-handed grips in front of themselves. The Clone and Tadataka both stood in front of Ryoga  with enough space in between them to maneuver against Ryoga's would-be attacks.

"[b]It's only fair. By myself I am no match for your technique. With two of me I stand a far better chance of not getting killed in this training exercise[/b]," remarked Tadataka as he flashed a 'come on' motion with his free hand. Give and take would be what defined this training session. What would be next would be decided by the rate of improvement from both men.

			[color=#DC143C]"If you say so, I'm just saying you have potential, whether you realize it or not is your choice. In any case, Make one of your clones attack me, while the other defends itself. Then you do what you want."[/color] Ryoga needed to practice switching from offense to defense and back again now. Normally, this was one of the few things he wasn't incredibly fast at. Ryoga found it hard to change it up on the fly. However, he would have to get used to it eventually, and what better time than with 3 opponents to practice against? Ryoga would have fun fighting these clones, despite them being semi weak, at least it would feel like he could really slice something without holding back.

Ryoga approached the first clone, which began a barrage of attacks against Ryoga. Though the clone had a weapon just like Tadataka, they were much slower than him, and since Ryoga had no trouble reading his movements, the clones were child's play. As the clone swung at Ryoga, he quick drew his sword while parrying the blade away. He let the clone recover after a brief moment, then as the clone came at him again, in one swift motion he parried the blade upwards, past Ryoga's head, then doubled back around, amputating the clone at the knees as it vanished.

Next Ryoga went at the second clone, which was prepared to defend itself, holding the wakizashi in a reverse grip. Ryoga slid his sword back into his sheath, as this was the basic principle of Iaido style. As Ryoga approached the clone, in one swift draw maneuver, slashed at the clone's midsection. The clone had actually gotten lucky and managed to put his blade in the way just in time, but it was no issue, as Ryoga once again sheathed his sword with blinding speed. Deciding enough was enough, Ryoga decided to use one of his favorite techniques to finish this fight, the Iai Beheading Draw. In one lightning fast motion, Ryoga snapped the blade from its sheath in a vertical slash from groin to skull, then just as quickly resheathed it. The clone, having no real perception, didn't even see Ryoga draw his blade, as the slice made itself clear a moment later, and the clone poofed away. With that, Ryoga began to walk towards Tadataka, but released his hand from his sheath, as he was done practicing this transition for the time being. [color=#DC143C]"It's almost embarrassing to admit I had such an issue with a seamless transition, it's so basic. How about some ninjutsu next, got anything you need to work on?"[/color]

			"[b]Actually, I was thinking of working on my Fuuton and Suiton jutsu. They are my specialties so I think it would be good to improve upon my knowledge of them[/b]," Tadataka said as he sheathed his Wakizashi and began to make hand signs. By the time he was finished with the signs; six Shadow Clones appeared next to Tadataka. Since the Shadow Clones could use jutsu and their experience was shared with Tadataka when they were dispersed--they were perfect for learning new jutsu. The jutsu that Tadataka was trying to learn were very similar in nature. Both allowed the user to coat their Fuuton chakra on projectiles but the difference between them were their control abilities. The more basic of the two--Wind Screw--would be the first technique that the clones--as well as Tadataka himself--would practice.

Each Tadataka removed a kunai from their leg pouches, and each of them held it in their right hands as they concentrated on the object with their chakra. None of them seemed to be able to channel their chakra to it at first. The kunai seemed non-responsive to the wills of the Tadataka's. It was something that eluded Takataka himself--that even though it was such a low-rank jutsu it was still difficult to begin from scratch. Slowly, however, swirls of chakra began to form. At first they were only translucent shimmers that seemed to be trying to find their way to the object that they were centered upon. It was as if the object itself was repelling them. Then the pattern became tighter around the kunai. When the pattern began to tighten one, Tadataka dismissed two of the clones to gain their insights on the problem. It had seemed that he acted too soon. The ones that he had dismissed were the least farthest along in the process, but at least now he could put more chakra into the creation of this jutsu.

With only five Tadataka's left, the pattern began to shape in a spiral and it became more and more solid on the kunai that they all held. It was then that Tadataka dismissed two more clones. Their insight was actually useful and it allowed the rest to create more stable forms on their kunai. Lastly, they began to throw the projectiles. The remaining clones threw at each other--with the real Tadataka not throwing his kunai--and their all disappeared. They gave all of their experience to Tadataka. By the time all of this had come to pass, Tadataka was able to form his Fuuton chakra around the kunai and throw it at a tree twenty yards away. The kunai cut nicely into the tree before Tadataka recovered it--satisfied.

New JutsuShow[color=lightgreen]*Wind Element • Wind Screw[/color]

D-ranked Ninjutsu

After doing the needed hand seals, the user creates a small vortex of Fuuton chakra around a projectile in their hand. This creates a small drill bit which can be used to “drill” into whatever the object hits. It lasts for three posts or if the projectile is thrown, twenty yards from the user before dissipating. This doesn't make the projectile any faster, only increases its ability to cut.

(454/400)

"[b]Why don't you go next while I recover a little. Then you can help me out by playing a game of... tag[/b]," Tadataka said as he walked back to Ryoga after retrieving his kunai.

At first they were only translucent shimmers that seemed to be trying to find their way to the object that they were centered upon. It was as if the object itself was repelling them. Then the pattern became tighter around the kunai. When the pattern began to tighten one, Tadataka dismissed two of the clones to gain their insights on the problem. It had seemed that he acted too soon. The ones that he had dismissed were the least farthest along in the process, but at least now he could put more chakra into the creation of this jutsu.

With only five Tadataka's left, the pattern began to shape in a spiral and it became more and more solid on the kunai that they all held. It was then that Tadataka dismissed two more clones. Their insight was actually useful and it allowed the rest to create more stable forms on their kunai. Lastly, they began to throw the projectiles. The remaining clones threw at each other--with the real Tadataka not throwing his kunai--and their all disappeared. They gave all of their experience to Tadataka. By the time all of this had come to pass, Tadataka was able to form his Fuuton chakra around the kunai and throw it at a tree twenty yards away. The kunai cut nicely into the tree before Tadataka recovered it--satisfied.

D-ranked Ninjutsu

After doing the needed hand seals, the user creates a small vortex of Fuuton chakra around a projectile in their hand. This creates a small drill bit which can be used to “drill” into whatever the object hits. It lasts for three posts or if the projectile is thrown, twenty yards from the user before dissipating. This doesn't make the projectile any faster, only increases its ability to cut.

(454/400)

"[b]Why don't you go next while I recover a little. Then you can help me out by playing a game of... tag[/b]," Tadataka said as he walked back to Ryoga after retrieving his kunai.

			[color=#DC143C]"Okay, i'll take this time to practice my sensing, I want to see if i can see your affinities."[/color] Ryoga was a skilled sensor, Pioneering his own method of sensing people's blood and pulse. He still had much to work on however, and a full list of Empathy techniques to create. He would start today with one that was simple in its application, but could prove useful in many different situations, as knowing an enemies affinities beforehand could prove to be a vital piece of information during a fight.

Ryoga put his hands together, building up Chiton chakra within his body to send out towards Tadataka and his clones. After he had a decent amount of chakra built up, Ryoga performed his hand seals as normal for his Feel the Pulse technique. Starting with tiger and ending with the ram seal. As he held this seal, his chakra flew from his body at an incredible speed, as Ryoga had great control over his chakra. It quickly passed over Tadataka and his clones, allowing Ryoga to easily tell which one was the real Tadataka, as only one of the bodies had a pulse. Next, Ryoga would perform a few additional seals, starting with the ram he left off on, and going through to the dragon seal. Once he finished these seals, Ryoga would focus in on the only pulse in the group of Tadatakas, using his Singled Out technique. This was usually more of a technique used to locate a target across great distance, but he needed to focus on tadataka in order to discern his affinities.

Finally Ryoga could try his new technique now. Ryoga would again begin to build up chakra inside his body. The technique in question was a D rank at best, and incredibly easy for someone like Ryoga to perform, it was all about being able to actually discern affinities for him. He suspected that due to his power over Suiton, that would be the only thing he was capable of seeing. However, as he saw Tadataka perform the Fuuton technique he desired, perhaps he would be able to see his fuuton affinity as well. Ryoga performed a few more hand seals, and after landing on the rat seal, Ryoga focused hard on Tadataka's body. As he felt the blood pulse within him, it became clear that Tadataka's affinities were indeed showing, as Ryoga could see a pale green aura as well as a blue aura similar to his own suiton affinity. As he released the jutsu, Ryoga relaxed a bit, then looked over at Tadataka. [color=#DC143C]"Good to know, I'd been meaning to develop my sensing abilities lately. Being able to see your affinities, or rather, my enemies affinities, will prove useful i'm sure. now, what's this tag your talking about?[/color]

			"[b]It's simple[/b]," Tadataka said with a menacing smile on his face. Slowly, at first, Tadataka began to make a few hand signs. Then he formed them faster and faster until he felt they were sufficient for use in a fight. It was then that he reached for the kunai that he had put away after his last maneuver and held it in his right hand. He began to focus his Fuuton chakra back into the kunai akin to the Wind Screw jutsu. This time it was different, however, and Tadataka saw fit to show it before speaking again. "[b]It's more like dodgeball, really, or dodge-kunai. I'm going to work on controlling this projectile here using my Fuuton chakra and I need a target to follow. Are you up for it?"

[/b]New JutsuShow[color=lightgreen]*Wind Element • Guided Projectile[/color]

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Performing the needed hand-seals, the user can cover an object within three meters that is roughly the same size as a shuriken or kunai with a thin Fuuton shell that allows them to guide the object’s path in flight. With the shell, the user can change the direction of the object three times while it is in the air. The technique lasts for three posts or until all turns are used; in both cases the shell dissipates from around the object. If the object still has the shell when it hits it mark, it will pierce more easily, due to the Fuuton surrounding it. If the user goes more than ten meters away from the object in question, they will lose the ability to guide it.

It should be simple; using the same methods of surrounding the projectile in Fuuton chakra, but at the same time the connection between Tadataka and his own chakra must last long enough to alter the movements of the projectile. It would be a tough predicament--to control something that was out of his hands in such a way with using only Fuuton chakra. There was only one way to get it right--practice. Practice is what makes everything perfect and Tadataka was determined to perfect everything he does.

It didn't take long for the Fuuton chakra bubble to form around the kunai. That had been the easy part considering the recent training with the Wind Screw jutsu. Next was the control; it was by far the more difficult part of the jutsu. This ability to control something in mid-flight would be very handy for change of direction attacks. It was this method that was the core of this game of dodge-kunai.

Tadataka gripped the kunai in his hand before throwing the Fuuton chakra coated kunai at Ryoga. It was obviously not meant to do him any harm, but as Tadataka had suggested, it was simply to tag him after making a few course corrections. The first kunai, however, would not be able to make a single course correction. The power was far too raw to be controlled with the ease that Tadataka had wanted. He would end his first attempt with a curse before retrieving the kunai and starting again. This time he would make a finer Fuuton chakra cocoon around the kunai before throwing it at Ryoga. Perhaps, if he were fast enough, Ryoga could use this opportunity to practice against a moving target as well.

This second attempt came from purse instinct as Tadataka was able to maneuver the course slightly. It was a victory--albeit a small one. It was then when it all came together with a combination of movements that allowed Tadataka to change the straight throw into a spinning kunai--which would easily be knocked to the ground by Ryoga if he deemed fit to stop it before it ran out of gas itself. Success was upon Tadataka yet again. So far this training session had been non-stop perfection for the two.

"[b]I think it's a draw[/b]," Tadataka said with a far less menacing smile. It was obvious that he now expected some sort of chastisement from Ryoga if he was unlucky enough to shock the older man, but in the end it would all be worth it to learn this new jutsu. Just to think what could be accomplished by moving a weapon so unsuspectingly when an opponent thinks they have evaded it. There was obvious sneak attack potential with this new jutsu. Just to think what would happen if the shell was still surrounding the projectile when it made contact--thrilling.

			[color=#DC143C]"Huh. I think I can manage that. Go ahead, try and hit me."[/color] There was a distinct challenging tone to Ryoga's voice, as he was almost completely sure that he could dodge whatever it was Tadataka planned to do. As he watched the Jounin coat his kunai with fuuton chakra, He was curious what exactly the man planned to do. He had planned to attempt to knock the weapon from the air, but with it being coated in chakra that might prove to be a problem. He wouldn't learn if he didn't try however, so Ryoga would at least attempt the clash draw technique.

Ryoga watched Tadataka very closely, waiting for Tadataka to throw the kunai. When he finally released it, Ryoga waited until it had gotten just within range of Ryoga. In an instant, Ryoga's sword was in the air, but he had missed the kunai somehow, as it went sailing over his head and impaled into the ground behind him. Ryoga was baffled that he had missed the kunai. Maybe he was too fast on the draw, or maybe he was too slow. He chuckled at the thought.

Tadataka walked over and picked back up his kunai to try again, then went once more to charge the weapon with chakra. Ryoga put his right hand once more on his katana, ready to counteract the kunai correctly this time. After a brief delay, once more Tadataka loosed the kunai towards Ryoga. Ryoga was fully prepared for this attack, ready to draw his blade and smack the kunai straight from the air. As it drew near, once again Ryoga slashed at the weapon, but again he missed the kunai. Though this time it wasn't because he missed, it was because the Kunai had changed direction. [color=#DC143C][i]"Heh, so this is what he meant by dodge the kunai, it changed direction. Guess that's what the Fuuton was for. No matter"[/i][/color]

The kunai continued changing direction in a sort of loop, circling around and again putting itself on a path to collide with Ryoga. This time he was sure he could swat it from the sky. As the kunai got within 10 feet of him, He gripped his sword tightly, and in one swift drawing motion, pulled his katana diagonally up, making contact with the kunai and flinging it into the air away from him. Ryoga was happy he finally managed to get that done, the fuuton had thrown him off slightly, but he was sure doing that to normal kunai would probably be easier. [color=#DC143C]"Not bad, i wasn't expecting it to change direction like that. Well, now what?"[/color]

OOC: 436/400 words for spoilered jutsu
Jutsu learnedShow *[color=#8B658B][b]Iaido • Clash Draw[/b][/color]

D-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 4 Speed

In this technique, the user assumes a firm stance and then draws their weapon in an upward arc. This sort of draw makes it easy to bat away projectiles moving at a Speed and Strength equal to or lower than the user's Speed and Strength. This also enables the user to cut through advancing techniques or to clash with an opponent's weapon. This movement, however, may leave the user without the ability to sheath his weapon for some time, limiting the effectiveness of their techniques until they can.

Ryoga was fully prepared for this attack, ready to draw his blade and smack the kunai straight from the air. As it drew near, once again Ryoga slashed at the weapon, but again he missed the kunai. Though this time it wasn't because he missed, it was because the Kunai had changed direction. [color=#DC143C][i]"Heh, so this is what he meant by dodge the kunai, it changed direction. Guess that's what the Fuuton was for. No matter"[/i][/color]

The kunai continued changing direction in a sort of loop, circling around and again putting itself on a path to collide with Ryoga. This time he was sure he could swat it from the sky. As the kunai got within 10 feet of him, He gripped his sword tightly, and in one swift drawing motion, pulled his katana diagonally up, making contact with the kunai and flinging it into the air away from him. Ryoga was happy he finally managed to get that done, the fuuton had thrown him off slightly, but he was sure doing that to normal kunai would probably be easier. [color=#DC143C]"Not bad, i wasn't expecting it to change direction like that. Well, now what?"[/color]

OOC: 436/400 words for spoilered jutsu
Jutsu learnedShow *[color=#8B658B][b]Iaido • Clash Draw[/b][/color]

D-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 4 Speed

In this technique, the user assumes a firm stance and then draws their weapon in an upward arc. This sort of draw makes it easy to bat away projectiles moving at a Speed and Strength equal to or lower than the user's Speed and Strength. This also enables the user to cut through advancing techniques or to clash with an opponent's weapon. This movement, however, may leave the user without the ability to sheath his weapon for some time, limiting the effectiveness of their techniques until they can.

			"[b]Next? How about some dummy training... only my clones are the dummies. Think you can kill them as fast as I can make them[/b]," Tadataka asked as he recovered the kunai from the last jutsu. That kunai was pretty durable, but now was its turn to rest while Tadataka did some training that didn't involve any weapons for a change. It was then, as he put the kunai away, that he turned to face Ryoga and settled into a comfortable stance. Quickly he moved his hands in familiar ways at a speed meant for combat. The signs formed one by one until a clone appeared before Ryoga. It was lifeless, but it was a start. The clone was made from nothing but chakra--a failure on Tadataka's part. He wouldn't show his disappointment, however, and would continue making signs as Ryoga would presumably deal with his failures.

In little time at all a second was formed, but its fate was the same as the last. A lifeless projection of chakra that only existed as a failure in the eyes of Tadataka. There was a sliver of hope, however, for when that clone was dealt with it released a slight gust of wind that showed Tadataka some promise through his eyes. He was getting closer and closer to his goal, and yet, there was something missing. Some key ingredient that made everything work. As to what that was? Tadataka would have to find the strength within himself to compose a mixture of his Fuuton chakra with his regular chakra in a perfect balance. The next clone that was created had a spark to him. He moved well enough with a slight spring in his step. It was as if he was gliding around on the grass as he attacked Ryoga.

"[b]It's gettin' there[/b]," Tadataka said after taking a breath of relief. A smile formed on Tadataka's lips. Perhaps he had fully realized his new jutsu so quickly that he would have time for another before lunch. What an enticing thought. However, as soon as the attack had begun, Tadataka realized that he was only half way there. The clone was more sluggish than he had imagined. Nor did it fight very well. The clone was obviously outmatched in every way, shape, and form. There was a glimmer of hope when it was struck down. That hope was a gust of wind with a strength of three within ten feet of the--now vanquished--clone. That was when the smile faded from his face. Instead that smile was replaced by a look of concentration as he took his stance, yet again, before speeding through a series of hand signals that concluded in the creation of a final clone.

"[b]Next up[/b]," stated Tadataka. He was seemingly rolling through the creation of the clones without a second though and now he had a feeling that he would be near completion of the jutsu that he longed to form before a perfectly unbalanced lunch of rice and ramen. Perfection, Tadataka was sure of it. He could feel the balance of chakra within this final clone. The Fuuton was just buzzing around inside of the regular chakra shell of this clone. The clone moved with enough speed for Tadataka to be satisfied. It flew towards Ryoga with that speed and attempted to attack him, but as Tadataka knew, without avail. There was no way that Ryoga would even let that clone touch him, but by now Tadataka was sure that Ryoga would realize what he was trying to do. More specifically, what jutsu he was trying to perfect. It wouldn't be long before that perfect clone met its end, but in doing so it would release a swirl of wind that would affect everything within 15 feet of the dying clone with a strength of six.

Although Tadataka had never used this jutsu fully before; it seemed to him that he knew what to expect when it reach its fruition. He was surprised, nor shocked, when it released the Fuuton chakra from within. It was like he knew what was going to happen before it did. Then again, it was he who created this clone, and he who had harnessed his chakra to accomplish what he had barely thought possible before. Now he had four different clone jutsu--besides the basic jutsu--that he could interchange to throw his enemies off of their game whenever he wished. They could think it would be one clone when it could suddenly explode with the force of the Wind Clone and suddenly the shock and awe would allow him to pounce upon them like a viper in the mist.

"[b]Perfect[/b]," Tadataka said as he took a confident stride towards Ryoga. There was an obvious tone of self pleasure within his single word statement. "[b]The Wind Clone jutsu. I do so enjoy my deceptions. Now I have another option to surprise my enemies with. What do you think[/b]," Tadataka inquired as he clapped his hands--applauding his own success. This was the first of the higher ranked jutsu that the pair had attempted to learn upon the day. It would be expected of Tadataka to take less time than his partner to learn these ninjutsu, but the opposite was true when it concerned taijutsu. Both of these men had their obvious strengths, but not-so-obvious weaknesses. That was what training was for; to eliminate your weaknesses, or at least learn to hide them better.

New JutsuShow[color=lightgreen][b]*Wind Element • Wind Clone Technique[/b][/color]

B-Ranked Ninjutsu

By performing some hand seals and concentrating both Fuuton and regular chakra, the user can create a clone. This clone looks identical to the user in every way, even possessing the same speed and strength. This clone can interact with the environment just like a kage bunshin, and it can go up to a mile away from the user. Once destroyed by any attack that would be lethal to a regular human, the clone bursts into a large gust of wind. This gust pushes back anything in a fifteen foot radius with 6 strength, while also causing minor cuts that would barely draw blood.

			[color=#DC143C]"Easily. Clones have no substance, it will only take one shot."[/color] Ryoga loved to flaunt his style of swordplay, just the act of drawing his sword from it's sheath made him feel great. The sound it made as it was pulled out in a slashing maneuver was music to his ears. In order to make killing the clones a fair game though, he would have to try something he wasn't used to doing normally. He was capable of building torque within his arms, as was evident by him performing the Iai Beheading Draw, but this technique was slightly different in its application. It was essentially an incredibly fast Iaido strike, beyond the comprehension of most inexperienced shinobi.

Ryoga placed his hand on his sword, and practiced the motion a few times, a simple draw followed by a horizontal slice, leaving the blade out and exposed unlike most normal Iaido techniques, which follow with an immediate resheath. He quickly pulled the sword from its sheath, analyzing the speed at which he drew the blade, then resheathed to try again, wanting to get the feel just right. After he had practiced this about 3 or 4 more times, Ryoga attempted the actual technique, building the torque within his muscles to a peak. All at once, Ryoga unsheathed his sword in a strike so fast that the blade was almost nothing but a blur. It was fast, but not as fast as Ryoga would want. It was time he tried it on a real target.

Ryoga watch Tadataka make his first clone, which was a botched attempt at best, and the second one was no better, as Ryoga simple walked forward and sliced it in two, feeling the wind blow his hair slightly. [color=#DC143C]"Come on, give me something that can move."[/color] As soon as those words left his mouth, another wind clone sprang into existance and sped towards Ryoga in an attack. Ryoga reflexively dodged the first swing, the second however caught him in his leg, as he wasn't paying close attention. He quickly examined the wound, finding it to be a flesh wound at best. Ryoga scoffed, then went back into it with the clone. As the clone went in for another strike, Ryoga weaved to the left while simultaneously drawing his sword, and while the technique was fast enough and powerful enough to slash through the clone effortlessly, it didn't take on the blur effect that he wanted. Ryoga threw his sword back into it's sheath with a scowl, as the clone exploded into a burst of fuuton that blew him backwards a few feet and caused a few minor cuts.

[color=#DC143C]"Hmmm, that was disappointing. I can produce the torque required for my other techniques, but not this? Give me one more go, I think i've got this."[/color] Ryoga was a very skilled swordsman, something like this shouldn't be giving him nearly as much trouble as it was. Perhaps this technique was a bit different in it's application, or the draw was a different sort of maneuver than his other techniques. But he remembered being told that the snap draw was essentially a really fast normal strike, his father told him that long ago. Ryoga had no choice but to keep trying though, he wouldn't admit failure in front of anyone, especially not someone he just met.

Tadataka seemed to have perfected his wind clone technique finally, as a fully formed clone of fuuton chakra now stood before him. Tadataka gave the clone the okay, and it proceeded to rush towards Ryoga. The clone got within mere inches of Ryoga, this one seemed faster and more complete than the previous ones. However, he was still much faster than any clone, and jumped backwards out of the way of the clone's swipe. [color=#DC143C]"This one is much better Tadataka, i'm impressed."[/color] Ryoga was starting to think maybe this man was a bit more skilled than he let on, but for now it wasn't important. The clones speed was enough to be able to dodge should it see a normal strike coming, so the only way to really destroy it was to attack faster than it could see. Ryoga took his stance, Right hand on his blade, and waited for the clone to make another approach. After a few seconds, the clone was after him once more, coming within 10 feet of Ryoga. Ryoga built the torque within his muscles to their peak, and with one fell swoop, his blade was fully extended to the right. It had seemed that Ryoga went straight from a sheathed stance to a fully extended draw, but the movement was so fast the clone hadn't seen the slash. A moment later, the clone exploded with a great force of wind, blowing Ryoga back about 10 feet and causing some good sized gashes on his body. He was bleeding, but to a Chiton user it was nothing serious, as he performed a few hand seals and clotted his wounds so that they might heal. [color=#DC143C]"The draw was a bit different for that technique than my others, it threw me off at first. But that clone caused some good damage for a clone, those winds caused some nice slashes."[/color] Ryoga said as he showed the slashes on his arm and clothing.

Jutsu learnedShow *[color=#8B658B][b]Iaido • Snap Draw[/b][/color]

C-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 6 Taijutsu, 6 Speed

With a honed body capable of producing torque within the user's muscles, the user is capable of achieving a 'Blurred Sword' effect in an attack. The user draws their sword with such speed and power, the strike itself goes undetected by opponents lacking Taijutsu greater than a third of the user's Taijutsu stat. While essentially similar to the basic Iaido technique this one is literally beyond the normal capability of the user and as such, it can only be used a number of times per thread equal to the user's stamina and taijutsu divided by 2.

C-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 6 Taijutsu, 6 Speed

With a honed body capable of producing torque within the user's muscles, the user is capable of achieving a 'Blurred Sword' effect in an attack. The user draws their sword with such speed and power, the strike itself goes undetected by opponents lacking Taijutsu greater than a third of the user's Taijutsu stat. While essentially similar to the basic Iaido technique this one is literally beyond the normal capability of the user and as such, it can only be used a number of times per thread equal to the user's stamina and taijutsu divided by 2.

			"[b]Not bad, not bad at all. Well, I think it is time for lunch! I have some rice and ramen. I like to keep it simple--takeout is all I can do. I don't cook much... at all. Unless you count field rations. I hope you brought something for yourself. I'm starved[/b]," Tadataka raved as he sped to his lunch bag and began to eat with the hunger and fury of a traditional Japanese hero. It was time for him to replenish his chakra reserves and nothing helped with that like a good meal and a quick break. It would be a welcome respite before training more upper class jutsu. Next would have to be something... spectacular.

New JutsuShow[color=dodgerblue][b]*Water Dragon Projectile[/b][/color]

B-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Water Dragon Projectile is a technique that uses the rushing force of water to cause devastating damage. By performing the required seals, the user will utilize a preexisting body of water in front of them before molding it into the form of a dragon head. Once it has been created, the user can launch the two-meter wide projectile towards a target at a speed equal to the average of their ninjutsu and control, with a maximum of ten. Following the head is a long body and tail, stretching nearly ten meters. This technique is able to travel up to thirty meters and is able to be maneuvered to an extent by the user. Up to three times the user may alter the course of the dragon, allowing it to complete a U-turn per alteration.

After lunch had concluded, and both parties were ready and able to resume their training, Tadataka rose from his seat on the ground. Firstly, he began to stretch his body to limber up after a nice break. He didn't want to pull anything in training. That would not end well with the schedule that he kept. Changing from his hardcore training would be a big black mark on his personal record. Secondly, however, he took his standard ready position. His legs were balanced in firm positions--as if connected to the ground like a root--and his body was open the the stream in front of him. It was time that he upped his game and showed Ryoga what he could do with his Suiton chakra.

Slowly, at first, Tadataka began to formulate signs with his hands. Over and over he repeated until an idea dawned upon him on how to improve this process. As quickly as he could learn a jutsu--it was far easier to enlist some help from his Shadow Clones, but due to the rank of this jutsu he thought it would be prudent only to create one other clone. That clone maneuvered his way to the other side of the stream so he was now facing the real Tadataka.

"[b]You ready[/b]," Tadataka questioned his mirrored counterpart. "[b]On three[/b]," Tadataka stated before beginning his count down. "[b]One... Two... Three[/b]," he finally exclaimed after taking a deep breath between each number that he spoke. When it came to the number three the race was on between the dueling Tatadaka's in order to see who could complete the jutsu first and best.

Each Tadataka maneuvered their hands swiftly and nimbly to form the signs for the jutsu. They each infused Suiton chakra into the jutsu, but at first it was to no avail. They repeated each step over and over until there was finally some movement on the surface of the water. It seemed as if the clone was beating Tadataka at his own game, and Tadataka couldn't allow a copy of himself to beat the real thing. No matter how insignificant the competition was; Tadataka always had to push and strive to be the best. He would not let anyone or anything beat him or keep him down. Tadataka would beat his own clone; of this he was sure.

Slowly, water from each bank of the steam began to rise and form together. Each individual droplet of water became sewn together for not more than an instant before splashing harmlessly back to the steam below. It was not before Tadataka let fly a few curses that both he and his clone continued to create these seals at a frightening pace. With each of their repetitions their individual speeds increased the amount of tries they accumulated for this justu. It was not long, however, until both of the Tadataka's were able to create something from the water. A small dragon-like head had appeared from each of their water formations. They weren't the full power of the jutsu--this was a fact--instead they were a smaller practice size. It wasn't long before both of the Tadataka's had decided that a duel of the Suiton Dragons had to commence.

Each of the heads spun to face each other before flashing towards the other. Each corrected their course around and around until there was a tall spiral that shot into the air with the two heads holding the top of the formation. It wasn't long after, however, that the water dragons exploded above the two Tadataka's. They had succeed at learning the jutsu--at least. There was some sense of satisfaction, but there was no clear winner of this jutsu learning competition. What a pity. This competition had now come to an end as the clone went away in a poof of smoke and thus provided its experience to Tadataka proper. The dragons had been reduced to rain and that rain poured over Tadataka in his gleeful state of success. No matter how you looked at it--he was the winner. It was a battle between Tadataka and himself, after all.

"[b]Well, that was something. I wonder how big I could get it with a lake or something. That would be pretty cool. What do you think, Ryoga[/b]," Tadataka questioned as he lowered himself to a squat on the bank of the steam. He let the water wash over his hands as he stuck them in to cool them down from the friction of creating all of those seals at such a high speed. So far that was the only true spectacle of the jutsu that had been learned on this day. There was no doubt that it was just the beginning!

			Ryoga wasn't one for eating during training, it made his stomach turn normally. [color=#DC143C]"I'm fine, i'll get something to eat afterwards, for now, go ahead and eat, i'll begin practicing my next technique."[/color] It was time Ryoga tackled something a bit more challenging with his sword training, another B rank Kenjutsu. This technique was more of a protective maneuver, meant for use should the user ever find themselves surrounded or something. It was essentially a lightning fast 360 degree spin with an Iaido slash attached to it. The taijutsu skill required to perform the maneuver, combined with how fast the slash must be, made it incredibly difficult to perform. Ryoga was bound to fail this one a few times, but the final result would be well worth the pain and toil.

Ryoga needed to set up the situation required for this technique to be used. He walked over to the stream going through the center of the area, and began forming some hand seals. A moment later, four water clones appeared around Ryoga, each at a 90 degree angle, therefore surrounding him at all sides. Each clone was about 3 feet away from him, with their hands on their weapons, as though they were ready to fight Ryoga. Of course, being a C rank clone jutsu, they weren't even close to his level, but they would serve their purpose. Ryoga prepared himself for the technique by taking his signature stance, legs spread for balance with his right hand on his sword, his left hand on his sheath, and his head tilted downwards. He began building tension in his body in his right hip and left leg, preparing to spin as fast as possible. First he would simply try the spin maneuver itself, his entire body quickly spiraling around full circle, returning to his starting position in a fraction of a second. It was a foreign thing for him, having normally been more about hip and arm movements than a full fledged spin that required leg rotation. This alone would probably prove to be the most difficult thing for him to do. Therefore, it was the thing he should work on the hardest.

Ryoga tried this spin once more, building a great amount of tension in his leg and hip again. As he preceded to start this spin, however, he would draw his sword, but not in a slash. He wanted to get a feel for the technique before he tried to really perform it. As he spun the same circle as before, the swords weight was just enough to throw him off balance, and he went spiraling to the ground, letting go of his sword which fell on his arm, creating a large gash on his right arm. [color=#DC143C]"Shit that hurt!"[/color] Ryoga winced in pain as he pulled himself from the ground, dripping blood like crazy. He quickly performed a few hand seals and clotted his wound, then performed a few more to help him produce more blood for what was lost. As he watched Tadataka finish his Water dragon, he would walk off to sit down and let his Red Cell Multiplication jutsu regenerate what was lost, as he sheathed his sword and sat down to take a break.
Jutsu usedShow *Bold Clotting

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the needed seals, the user will place their hand over an open wound up to five inches wide and two inches deep. After channeling Chiton chakra for a full post, the user will form a superficial blood-clot covering over the wound to prevent further bloodflow from it. While this cover doesn't completely heal the wound, it allows the target's body to recover from the wound naturally without agitation.

*Red Cell Multiplication

B-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the needed seals, the user will channel Chiton chakra into their own body or into the body of a willing or subdued target. After the chakra has been channeled, as long as the user or target avoids strenuous movement, the amount of blood cells in their body will regenerate 3 gallons of blood every post for a duration of four posts. If the user engages in strenuous activity, however, then they will regenerate only 1 gallon of blood instead. The technique will not end once the user returns to their maximum amount of blood, but rather simply stop multiplication until further replacement is needed or the duration of the jutsu ends.

			"[b]You good[/b]," Tadataka asked as he saw Ryoga mending his injuries. He had to stifle from laughing at first. The brooding ninja that spun around and gave himself a boo boo with his own sword--now that was funny. Usually Tadataka would be more serious about injuries and the like, but this was training, and in training death is less of a possibility than in the field or sparring. They would have to spar eventually, however, Tadataka knew that would be a fun learning experience. Next was time for a new jutsu though. Something that would be the best he had ever learned. A rank A jutsu by the name of the Elite Attack Clone.

New JutsuShow[color=dodgerblue][b]*Elite Attack Clone[/b][/color]

A-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Water Clone Technique, Control Stat of 9

After performing a string of seals, the user will create a large amount of water and manipulate it to form a larger version of the normal clone. The clone stands two meters tall and is quite adept in close-ranged combat. Despite the fact that it cannot perform any techniques, it possesses whip-like arms that extend seven feet and are about one foot in diameter. Should a target get struck by one of the arms, the arm will envelop the portion of the body that made contact and can be broken out of if the target has a strength exceed the clone’s own.

This clone was not like all of the others that he possessed. It was true that it would not be able to use jutsu, but with its whip-like arms that could extend out to seven full feet and envelop anything they touched, it was safe to say it would be a very valuable addition to his rapidly growing repertoire. To begin to accomplish this venture, however, started with manifesting a good quantity of water. Tadataka could, of course, use the water from the stream like he had done for the Water Dragon jutsu, but if he should ever strike battle far enough from a water source than that would do him no good. He had decided to manifest the water himself.

Tadataka began by making a slew of hang seals that seemed to only puff out his cheeks by a large margin, but in fact it had gathered his Suiton chakra and it allowed him to vomit up enough water to form a simple water clone of himself. It was a quick start, but that was by far the least challenging bit to this formidable jutsu. The next part was tricky. Tadataka would have to alter the structure of the clone to--instead of using low rank suiton jutsu--be able to extend its arms and envelop anything it touches. Not to mention making the clone all around better on offense as opposed to a more balanced form of defense. This clone was to be use strictly for an attack while Tadataka himself would simply provide support to the clone in an actual battle. Perhaps there were even more ways that this clone to be utilized, but as for now, it was restricted to this singular purpose as Tadataka was attempting to learn this technique.

The basic water clone that Tadataka had created with a simple staple of any suiton clone jutsu. It was a completely normal--lowly skilled-clone. Tadataka had decided to take a moment to look over his own clone--he had to check and see what exactly would be the differences between the two types of water clones. At first Tadataka had thought that it would just be the offensive capabilities, but it didn't take long for him to figure out that the Elite Attack Clone would be far superior in every way. It would be stronger, faster, and be able to withstand more punishment than an average water clone. It would completely revolutionize Tadataka's battle tactics.

Next, it was time for Tadataka to try again. He summoned his suiton chakra into his mouth and it exploded outwards and formed into a new clone--after he had already made all of the hand signs--that seemed to be dripping with water. The clone started out a little taller than Tadataka himself, but it began to leak away into the stream that was still in front of him. That attempt would be marked as a complete failure. In his quest to expand the size of the water clone, it was all but disastrous. He had attempted to put too much water into it for the growth of the clone. That was a mistake that he would not make again, but how would he make the clone bigger and more able to readily expand towards the enemy?

For this attempt Tadataka took a bit longer to gather his suiton chakra before making his hand signs at a speed that showed he was growing more comfortable with them, and then, all at once he spewed out another watery mess. This time it was only identical to him in height, but it seemed to move a little bit better than the other attempts had. The bottom line was that this was still a failure. Determination was a trait that many great ninja had, and Tadataka was no exception that that lineage. He would just have to figure out how to better control his suiton chakra while it formed into a suiton clone. He knew that it would have to be larger in stature than he was in order to be able to manipulate itself and increase its own length at will. Then, to envelop anything it touched beyond that, well it was a venture worth tiring out over.

Tadataka returned to his starting stance and whipped out those hand signs as fast as the last time. He even spewed out a good amount of water for the clone to take form. It was roughly two meters tall--meaning about four inches taller than Tadataka himself. The size wasn't the best overall improvement, however, in this latest suiton clone. Although it couldn't move very well--it possessed the ability to transform its arms to various lengths and sizes. Envelopment, on the other hand, was still out of the question. Not to mention that it didn't move in the way it should from a perfect creation. Tadataka would have to try again. Hopefully he wouldn't tire himself out too much. This was a lot of jutsu in one day and he didn't exactly have the best stamina in the world. It was a good thing he had taken a lunch break to replenish all he had lost on the earlier training regimen.

Now was the time. Tadataka felt it in his body as the chakra formed in his mouth after he completed the seals for--hopefully--a final time on the day. His cheeks expanded and he released the mass of water from his mouth. From that collection of suiton chakra formed a clone that was just the right size--around two meters yet again--and after a few moments of poking, prodding, and a few drills to test the suiton clone's maneuverability, Tadataka was satisfied with his progress. There was still two things left to see, however, and those were the expansion ability and the ability to envelop anything it touched. Tadataka had to pause before he ordered the clone to attack him. He knew the risks that were involved if anything went wrong, but Tadataka felt confident in his ability not to die as much as he felt confident in his ability to get this jutsu right!

Slowly, Tadataka walked out to about seven feet away before signaling the Elite Attack Clone to begin his assault. To Tadataka's own amazement the clone's arms sprang forth like geysers headed straight for him. He moved quickly to avoid the first few strikes before the arms caught up with him and touched him at his legs. Success! His legs had became enveloped in his own suiton chakra that was controlled by his newest jutsu creation! This was the hardest he had ever trained before and this jutsu was well worth the price he had to pay in energy and patience.

"[b]Finally! I did it[/b]," Tadataka exclaimed with an overt tone of enjoyment before collapsing to the ground after his release of the newest clone in his arsenal. It was quite a feat to behold, and in such a short time. "[b]What do you think of that one Ryoga!? Can you do better[/b]," asked Tadataka in a somewhat challenging tone. This was a competition, after all. If it wasn't then they were just lying to themselves.

"[b]You good[/b]," Tadataka asked as he saw Ryoga mending his injuries. He had to stifle from laughing at first. The brooding ninja that spun around and gave himself a boo boo with his own sword--now that was funny. Usually Tadataka would be more serious about injuries and the like, but this was training, and in training death is less of a possibility than in the field or sparring. They would have to spar eventually, however, Tadataka knew that would be a fun learning experience. Next was time for a new jutsu though. Something that would be the best he had ever learned. A rank A jutsu by the name of the Elite Attack Clone.

New JutsuShow[color=dodgerblue][b]*Elite Attack Clone[/b][/color]

A-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Water Clone Technique, Control Stat of 9

After performing a string of seals, the user will create a large amount of water and manipulate it to form a larger version of the normal clone. The clone stands two meters tall and is quite adept in close-ranged combat. Despite the fact that it cannot perform any techniques, it possesses whip-like arms that extend seven feet and are about one foot in diameter. Should a target get struck by one of the arms, the arm will envelop the portion of the body that made contact and can be broken out of if the target has a strength exceed the clone’s own.

			Ryoga pulled himself from the ground as he watched Tadataka finish his Water clone technique. [color=#DC143C]"An impressive display, i'll admit. But no, I can't perform a clone of that level, I don't rely on my clones too often, except for, well, what i'm using them for now."[/color] Ryoga's water clones were just training dummies to him, to be cut down by his sword. But as far as a competition would go, as long as he was capable of swinging his sword he was still good to continue training. He took his sword from it's sheath and practiced swinging it a few times, making sure that the wound on his arm wouldn't cause him any issues. There was some pain, but nothing he wasn't used to, and his blood had been completely replenished by this point.

Ryoga would get this technique right if it killed him, and he sure as hell wouldn't be made to look like a fool in front of Tadataka. The clones once more surrounded Ryoga, each at the same position as before, 3 feet away from him, just within sword's reach. Ryoga needed to perfect this spin before he tried drawing his sword again, another mishap like that and he might as well go home. He took his stance again, and began building the tension within his muscles, preparing himself to rotate on his leg, using the force of his draw and the tension in his hip to propel him in the rotation. All at once Ryoga's entire body was almost a blur, spinning a full 360 degrees without stopping, rotating on his left leg while sliding the right leg across the ground, and faking a sword draw, so that his arm might help push him in his spin. It seemed he had the hang of his spinning technique, now he just had to put it all together into one super fast maneuver.

Ryoga beckoned the clones to come closer, as they each took a single step, now within 2 feet of Ryoga. He had enough room to draw his sword, but the clones were literally where the base of the blade would be should he perform the move correctly. The fact that this spinning slash was giving him such trouble bugged Ryoga to no end, but that would soon change. Ryoga once again began building the tension in his leg and hip to their maximum potential, grabbing hold of his blade in his signature stance, left hand on his sheath to stabilize it while he drew his sword. After preparing his muscles for the final move, Ryoga performed the technique almost flawlessly, spinning on his left leg, while simultaneously pulling his katana from it's sheath as he rotated and extending it in a signature Iaido slash, following through with the strike for the full 360 degree spin. The strike wasn't a blur like his other techniques of this level, but it retained the same destructive power, as each of the clones burst into nothing when the blade passed through them. Satisfied with the results of his strike, Ryoga sheathed his sword and crossed his arms, eyes closed as he contemplated where to go from there. [color=#DC143C]"Your techniques are good, but don't get cocky Tadataka. As you see, my blade is more than quick enough to deal with anything that may come my way."[/color]

			"[b]Perhaps, but you shouldn't be overconfident as well. There is always someone better. My only hope is that I don't find him or her before I have a chance to at least live some of my life[/b]," Tadataka stated in a somber tone. It was not often that he talked so glumly when not about to face a daring mission where he would risk life and limb. Somehow, however, Tadataka felt at home with this man he had just met. It was almost like the two were different paths of the same man.

Tadataka shook his head dismissively at his own words before settling down next to the steam again. He expended a lot of chakra to learn that last jutsu, but he figured that he could at least learn a low level jutsu with what he had left. The only question was which type to learn. Tadataka himself was confused on what to do next, but it was then when he figured it out after sucking in a deep breath and releasing it across the water. It seemed that nature was the biggest inspiration to Tadataka when it came to figuring out new jutsu. It was a wonder if the marvels of the outside world could ever be mastered in so many jutsu. At least Tadataka would try to master his slice of the elements...

New JutsuShow[color=lightgreen]*Wind Element • Air Gun[/color]

D-rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals, the user will take a deep breath before blowing it out in the form of a football-sized bullet. If hit by it, it can cause many small cuts at the place of impact. The further this is shot, the weaker it becomes, becoming completely ineffective at twenty-five yards.

Tadataka just squatted on the bank of the stream; he began to make some hand signs, but he wasn't exactly sure that his full interest was in creating this new jutsu after all of the others that he had created on this day alone. Nonetheless his Fuuton chakra began flowing vigorously within him as he made this hand signs. The concept was simple enough--gather Fuuton chakra in his mouth and spit it out. It was so easy even some academy students could probably figure out how to do it given some time. And so it was; as Tadataka sucked in air--as if he was dying of suffocation--before his cheeks widened and then regressed just as fast as they expanded. As they did so his mouth opened and shot out a football sized collection of Fuuton chakra that blew across the top of the stream and caused it to slightly part.

The only question now was what Ryoga would do next. He couldn't just let Tadataka show up up like that with a mighty jutsu such as the Elite Attack Clone was. After all, wasn't power the thing to be respected among these two blossoming Jounin?

"[b]Perhaps, but you shouldn't be overconfident as well. There is always someone better. My only hope is that I don't find him or her before I have a chance to at least live some of my life[/b]," Tadataka stated in a somber tone. It was not often that he talked so glumly when not about to face a daring mission where he would risk life and limb. Somehow, however, Tadataka felt at home with this man he had just met. It was almost like the two were different paths of the same man.

Tadataka shook his head dismissively at his own words before settling down next to the steam again. He expended a lot of chakra to learn that last jutsu, but he figured that he could at least learn a low level jutsu with what he had left. The only question was which type to learn. Tadataka himself was confused on what to do next, but it was then when he figured it out after sucking in a deep breath and releasing it across the water. It seemed that nature was the biggest inspiration to Tadataka when it came to figuring out new jutsu. It was a wonder if the marvels of the outside world could ever be mastered in so many jutsu. At least Tadataka would try to master his slice of the elements...

New JutsuShow[color=lightgreen]*Wind Element • Air Gun[/color]

D-rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals, the user will take a deep breath before blowing it out in the form of a football-sized bullet. If hit by it, it can cause many small cuts at the place of impact. The further this is shot, the weaker it becomes, becoming completely ineffective at twenty-five yards.

Tadataka just squatted on the bank of the stream; he began to make some hand signs, but he wasn't exactly sure that his full interest was in creating this new jutsu after all of the others that he had created on this day alone. Nonetheless his Fuuton chakra began flowing vigorously within him as he made this hand signs. The concept was simple enough--gather Fuuton chakra in his mouth and spit it out. It was so easy even some academy students could probably figure out how to do it given some time. And so it was; as Tadataka sucked in air--as if he was dying of suffocation--before his cheeks widened and then regressed just as fast as they expanded. As they did so his mouth opened and shot out a football sized collection of Fuuton chakra that blew across the top of the stream and caused it to slightly part.

The only question now was what Ryoga would do next. He couldn't just let Tadataka show up up like that with a mighty jutsu such as the Elite Attack Clone was. After all, wasn't power the thing to be respected among these two blossoming Jounin?

			When Ryoga heard Tadataka call him overconfident, all bets were off. [color=#DC143C]"That's just it Tadataka, as long as i keep it up, there [b]won't[/b] be anyone better than me. Allow me to demonstrate."[/color] Ryoga thought it was time to finish this training session with Tadataka, but not before putting him in his place. In order to do this technique though, he required a large amount of blood to work with. Luckily, he had techniques for this, and after performing a few seals, he stomped the ground and brought forth his Guardian Fountain, spewing forth from the ground in front of him. [color=#DC143C]"This might get messy, stand back."[/color]

Ryoga would give Tadataka some time to back off a bit, then he proceeded to perform even more hand seals, building up his chiton chakra within his palms and placing them to the ground near his fountain. In a few moments, it would turn to the blood he needed, but for the time being he would simply practice building his chakra up for this technique. He had a great many hand seals to do for this technique, as he had to mold his chakra almost perfectly to perform and maintain the jutsu in question. He began running through some hand seals, getting a feel for which seals would prove to be the most effective. After a moment, he started on the Tiger seal, then continued going through more seals, hitting the Dog seal, serpent seal, ram seal, and ending on the Tiger seal once more. There were at least fifteen seals to the technique though, as it took a lot of chakra molding to do what Ryoga was trying to do.

Ryoga now had a good feel for the hand seals he wanted to perform for the technique, and considering it was an A rank technique, it would no doubt take a large amount of chakra, especially since he would hold the jutsu as a channel. At this point, the ground was almost completely saturated with water, but no blood came from the fountain yet. [color=#DC143C]"Hmph, it doesn't matter, i'll just get a feel for molding the chakra within me." [/color] Ryoga would have to wait to practice the technique completely, but he would still try to get a feel for the jutsu itself. He began building an incredibly large amount of chiton chakra, feeling it course within his veins. The power that he felt was larger than anything else he had performed thus far, proving that this technique was definitely an A rank jutsu. Ryoga then began performing the hand seals from before, going through seal after seal, and ending on the tiger seal. He then went to draw his sword to get a feel for what he wanted to perform, but as he went to draw his blade, thus breaking the hand seal, his chakra was lost, as though it never built up to begin with. Ryoga cursed under his breath, as it seemed that performing the technique with two hands wasn't the right idea here. The plan was to use his sword to control his jutsu, however he couldn't break the hand seal to draw his blade, and he couldn't perform hand seals with the blade in his hand.

[color=#DC143C]"Well, two handed seals aren't the answer here it seems, i'll have to do this with one handed seals i think. A bit harder to perform, but it will all be worth it in the end."[/color] Ryoga couldn't let Tadataka one up him so easily, performing clone after clone. Clone jutsu weren't bad at all, but Tadataka missed the point of creating A rank jutsu. Everything he had learned so far had been straight from a scroll or manual somewhere, It seemed he hadn't yet delved into his own style of jutsu creation. Ryoga however, would show him what A ranks were truly capable of, as he began performing a string of one handed seals without chakra at first. One handed seals weren't something he was especially skilled in, but he did know how to perform them, and as such, would have no trouble getting a nice string of seals planned out for molding his chiton chakra the way he wanted. He had an idea how the technique would go, now he simply needed to wait for his fountain to turn to blood, so that he could have something to manipulate his chakra into, not just building it and releasing it inside of him.

Jutsu usedShow *Guardian Fountain

C-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Control Stat of 6

Requiring a slightly above average level of control, this technique generates a large amount of water as a defense mechanism. By performing a string of seals, the user will stomp and create a fountain of water from the ground that flows at a speed of five. The fountain is three meters in diameter and four meters in height. This technique lasts for three posts. All in all, this creates just over eight thousand cubic meters of water.

Blood Fountain

D-rank Ninjutsu

Prerequisites: *Guardian Fountain[/b], Control stat of 8

After creating the Guardian Fountain, Ryoga adds a few additional handseals and puts his palms to the ground near the fountain, channeling Chiton chakra into the stream. One post later, the fountain changes from a stream of water to a stream of blood matching Ryoga's bloodtype. The fountain is only 2 feet tall, and flows a bit slower then the Guardian Fountain, therefore producing only about 4000 cubic meters of blood. The blood will completely vanish from the field after 10 posts.

Who knows[/b]," Tadataka said with a probing smile. It was more of not knowing what to expect from Ryoga. It had been a long session, however, and Tadataka was content to regain some of his strength while Ryoga learned a new jutsu. The blood fountain, however, was interesting enough.

			[color=#DC143C]"...You're a lot deeper than you look. The only reason i'd ever have to kill you is if you bail on the village, and I won't hesitate to hunt you down. But in any case, It would be interesting. Now, back to focus."[/color] Ryoga was going to finish this technique before he left today, he had to show his supremacy. The hand seals from before began taking effect, as the fountain changed from water to blood, slowing down and covering the ground with a torrent of blood. The ground was saturated already, so the blood would sit at the top of the ground, for the most part. Ryoga watched as the ground began covered more and more in his blood, until it got to a respectable amount. Once it got to the point he thought he had enough blood, he drew his sword once more and began performing a string of seals with his left hand, building an immense amount of chiton chakra inside of him, trying to raise his blood from the ground in front of him. The blood bubbled and moved before bursting into the air in a pillar of blood about 10 feet tall. It was impressive to be sure, but not nearly as big as he wanted it to be, Ryoga would have to mold his chakra more precisely to make his blood take the size and shape that he wanted it to.

Ryoga decided to place his sword back into his sheath for the time being, to attempt simply forming the first part of the jutsu. Sheathing his sword and keeping his right hand open, he again placed his left hand out in front of him in the form of a hand seal. Ryoga felt the blood beneath his feet quiver as he began once more building a huge amount of chakra within his body. His hand was a blur, performing hand seal after hand seal in quick succession. Each seal he performed made him feel like his chakra was taking true shape, getting more powerful with each movement. Finally, after landing on the final seal, he focused hard on the large pool of blood beneath him, focusing all of his chakra into an area 10 feet away from him, molding it up into the air. The pillar of blood grew to a size of 20 meters this time, towering over the two jounin. Ryoga then poured more chakra into the pillar and watched as it took shape, forming into a giant arm of blood. This was a big step in the right direction, however the jutsu still was not complete, for as Ryoga went to move his other arm, the arm did not respond, simply staying straight in the air, immobile. Ryoga scoffed and released the final seal, the tower of blood falling down to the ground once more. Ryoga wasn't satisfied, this time he would perfect the technique.

Ryoga's right hand quickly grabbed his hilt, pulling his sword from it's sheath once more. Ryoga held his sword out to his right, pointed away from him with his arm straight, and positioned his left hand in front of him once more in a one handed seal. Ryoga's hand was once more a blur of speed, flying through the hand seals one after another, each one molding his chakra into what would be his finished technique. Ryoga's hand froze as it landed on the final seal, holding it in perfect position as his chakra saturated the blood lining the ground. He felt the blood flow beneath him as a huge amount of blood began moving to an area 5 feet in front of Ryoga, coming from all directions and shooting up into the air, forming the same 20 meter arm as before, but looking much more defined. Ryoga tested the arm by moving his right arm, and felt an ease run over him as he saw that the arm was indeed mimicking his movements. He had succeeded in retaining control over his chakra after it had taken shape, but it wasn't finished yet. Ryoga focused as much chakra as he could into the arm, and finally a 10 meter sword of blood sprang forth from the Arm's palm. Ryoga's arm dropped to his side, and the arm followed suite, pointing the sword at the ground in front of him. Finally satisfied with his technique, Ryoga glanced at Tadataka with a look of victory before he lifted his arm and swung it in front of him, watching as the arm decimated a few trees about 25 meters away. [color=#DC143C]"And that's the power of Ryoga Kazuki. Let that keep you from ever leaving Kirigakure."[/color] Ryoga said with a smirk before sheathing his blade, dropping his left arm, and watching the blood fall before him once more into the blood on the ground

[color=#DC143C]"...You're a lot deeper than you look. The only reason i'd ever have to kill you is if you bail on the village, and I won't hesitate to hunt you down. But in any case, It would be interesting. Now, back to focus."[/color] Ryoga was going to finish this technique before he left today, he had to show his supremacy. The hand seals from before began taking effect, as the fountain changed from water to blood, slowing down and covering the ground with a torrent of blood. The ground was saturated already, so the blood would sit at the top of the ground, for the most part. Ryoga watched as the ground began covered more and more in his blood, until it got to a respectable amount. Once it got to the point he thought he had enough blood, he drew his sword once more and began performing a string of seals with his left hand, building an immense amount of chiton chakra inside of him, trying to raise his blood from the ground in front of him. The blood bubbled and moved before bursting into the air in a pillar of blood about 10 feet tall. It was impressive to be sure, but not nearly as big as he wanted it to be, Ryoga would have to mold his chakra more precisely to make his blood take the size and shape that he wanted it to.

Ryoga decided to place his sword back into his sheath for the time being, to attempt simply forming the first part of the jutsu. Sheathing his sword and keeping his right hand open, he again placed his left hand out in front of him in the form of a hand seal. Ryoga felt the blood beneath his feet quiver as he began once more building a huge amount of chakra within his body. His hand was a blur, performing hand seal after hand seal in quick succession. Each seal he performed made him feel like his chakra was taking true shape, getting more powerful with each movement. Finally, after landing on the final seal, he focused hard on the large pool of blood beneath him, focusing all of his chakra into an area 10 feet away from him, molding it up into the air. The pillar of blood grew to a size of 20 meters this time, towering over the two jounin. Ryoga then poured more chakra into the pillar and watched as it took shape, forming into a giant arm of blood. This was a big step in the right direction, however the jutsu still was not complete, for as Ryoga went to move his other arm, the arm did not respond, simply staying straight in the air, immobile. Ryoga scoffed and released the final seal, the tower of blood falling down to the ground once more. Ryoga wasn't satisfied, this time he would perfect the technique.

Ryoga's right hand quickly grabbed his hilt, pulling his sword from it's sheath once more. Ryoga held his sword out to his right, pointed away from him with his arm straight, and positioned his left hand in front of him once more in a one handed seal. Ryoga's hand was once more a blur of speed, flying through the hand seals one after another, each one molding his chakra into what would be his finished technique. Ryoga's hand froze as it landed on the final seal, holding it in perfect position as his chakra saturated the blood lining the ground. He felt the blood flow beneath him as a huge amount of blood began moving to an area 5 feet in front of Ryoga, coming from all directions and shooting up into the air, forming the same 20 meter arm as before, but looking much more defined. Ryoga tested the arm by moving his right arm, and felt an ease run over him as he saw that the arm was indeed mimicking his movements. He had succeeded in retaining control over his chakra after it had taken shape, but it wasn't finished yet. Ryoga focused as much chakra as he could into the arm, and finally a 10 meter sword of blood sprang forth from the Arm's palm. Ryoga's arm dropped to his side, and the arm followed suite, pointing the sword at the ground in front of him.

			"[b]Cute. I would imagine you would be really screwed if someone attacked you from behind while controlling that thing though[/b]," Tadataka jested. In truth it was a frightening sight that nearly caused Tadataka to use his own jutsu in a reaction, but he hadn't, nor had he shown his fear outwardly. Tadataka would never show Ryoga how much his new jutsu had stirred fear inside of him; instead he would only show a resolve to best him the next time they trained together.

"[b]We must do this again sometime. I have an inkling of a jutsu that might impress you as well[/b]," he said with a certain glimmer of scheme in his eyes. "[b]Until then... I think it is about time we go off on our own business. See you soon[/b]."

[b]Combat Style:[/b] Tenchu is mainly an up close and personal Taijutsu fighter. Occasionally he may decide to throw some nintai into the mix, but he is primarily an expert in unarmed fighting. If he is kept at bay, he relies on his katon to whittle his opponents down.

[b]Strong Fist Style[/b]

The Strong Fist Style has a single goal in mind: overpower. The style requires above average physical prowess and muscles trained and prepped for extraneous battles and exercises. The style’s main target is the external body, inflicting blow upon blow, whittling away the opponent’s stamina while keeping the user’s own at peak. The techniques themselves are relatively simple, but require precise muscle memory to accurately place attacks efficiently.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b]

[b]Jutsu:[/b]

Strong FistShow [b]*Leaf Gale[/b]

D-Rank Taijutsu

With the intention to disrupt, the user analyzes the opponent's movements. The user then angles a leg below or above a charging target's center of gravity. With a strike to an unprepared or vulnerable area, the user attempts to knock their opponent off balance as a means to interrupt the target's attack or set up for another attack of their own.

[b]*Dynamic Action[/b]

D-Rank Taijutsu

As a lengthening distance is commonly a weakness of many close range fighters, the principle of [b]Dynamic Action[/b] aims elliminate the option of retreat. In this technique, the user focuses on advancement in attempts to lock the target from creating distance. In a linear movement, the user "pushes" the target back with a flurry of strikes and kicks. As the attacks may generate "knock-back", the user makes the appropriate movements to keep the foe in range

[b]*Dynamic Entry[/b]

D-Rank Taijutsu

In this technique, the user builds movement and speed in order to bridge the gap between themselves and a distanced target. After collpasing an appropriate distance, the user then looses a form of distraction, like a thrown object, in order to waive the target's attention. The user then leaps with their momentum, delivering a strong kick to bridge the rest of the distance.

[b]Leaf Upper[/b]

C-rank Taijutsu

This moves primary focus is putting the target into the air for follow up techniques. The user will get within range of the target, and attempt to uppercut the enemy in their chin, sending them skyward. The target flies in the air, going up one meter for each strength point the user has over the target. The user then follows the target into the air to follow up with other techniques.

[b]Leaf Hurricane[/b]

C-Rank Taijutsu

This technique is meant to close the gap between the user and the target with a powerful hurricane kick. The user leaps into the air, performing a few rotations before hitting the target with a roundhouse kick. The buildup of the technique makes it faster and stronger, but much less precise, increasing the users strength and speed by 1 by one and decreasing the users tai by 2 for the strike.
KatonShow *[color=orangered][b]Fire Element • Flame Bullet Technique[/b][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the needed hand seals, the user focuses Katon chakra into one of their hands. This causes a fireball to form in the palm of their hand. They can then throw the fireball the same as they would any other projectile. If hit, the fireball causes light burning, barely a first-degree burn. If not thrown within two posts, the ball will dissipate into the air. The fireball typically only travels 20 or so feet before burning out.

*[color=orangered][b]Fire Element • Cauterization Technique[/b][/color]

D-Rank Iijutsu

After performing the needed hand seals, the user concentrates Katon chakra into one of his fingers, forming a tiny flame. They then place their finger on an minor wound, no longer than 6 inches and no wider than 1/2 inch, drawing theirfinger across the wounded flesh. After a period of 1 post and a great deal of pain, the wound will be cauterized.

[color=orangered][b]Fire Element • Hands of Flame[/b][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the needed hand seals, the user focuses Katon chakra into his hands. The chakra, when focused, causes their hand to form flames around their hands for a small period of time, lasting for roughly three posts. The chakra is not actually on the user's hands, therefore any handgear remains undamaged. Attacks made with the hands can cause first-degree burns upon contact, giving a taijutsu user an edge in battle.

[color=orangered][b] Fire Element • Great Flame Bullet Technique[/b][/color]

C-rank Ninjutsu

Prerequiste: Fire Element • Flame Bullet Technique

After performing the needed handseals the user places their palms together by their dominant side. The user then builds a large amount of Katon chakra between their hands, forming a large fireball in their hands. They can then shoot the ball at a target by thrusting their palms forward. If hit, the fireball hits with a strength of 5, causing second degree burns and searing the opponents flesh. This jutsu flies with a speed of 6 for 50 meters before dispersing.

[color=orangered][b]Fire Element • Firebird Strike[/b][/color]

C-Rank Nintaijutsu

After completing a short set of hand seals the user will flood their entire fist with Katon chakra. As they do this, their hand will be engulfed in an aura of searing hot flames that can cause up to second-degree burns on impact. The aura surrounds the users hands, leaving any handgear undamaged. The user then attempts to punch their target in their chin, performing a strong uppercut, but as they complete this initial attack the aura of flames engulfing the user’s hand will explode violently forward. The blast is very limited in range however, only extending forward about six inches and if it's not used within a post of initiating the technique it will fizzle out, wasting chakra. The blast is equal in power to three exploding tags. If executed on someone with less than six strength, this technique will blast them off of their feet, sending them flying upwards about twenty feet, and causing severe second degree burns.

[b]History[/b]
Tenchu was born to a normal family in Konoha, neither of his parents were ninja, proving to be meager members of the village, doing odd jobs to make their way, though his grandparents were among the top jounin of the village. Even as a child, the boy had a drive to become better at whatever he did, as was apparent by him always performing his chores as fast as possible, never once complaining that it was too hard or too much. Eventually, when he was 7, he began feeling that he was better than what he was doing, better than chores and meaningless work. it wasn't long after he had these thoughts that he learned from other village members that his grandparents, who he had never met, were among the elite of Konoha shinobi. From their his path was decided, and he enrolled in the academy at the age of 8.

Life in the academy wasn't too bad for Tenchu, as he proved to be an incredibly strong taijutsu user, due to his constant chores having hardened his body. One of his teachers took an interest in his physical prowess, and began teaching him the basics of Gouken Ryuu, the Strong fist style. Tenchu looked up to his teacher as a sensei of sorts, but it wasn't an official Senpai-Kohai relationship. It wasn't long after he began learning Gouken Ryuu that he discovered his affinity for Katon. It came so naturally to him that he began applying it to his fighting style just before he graduated from the academy. When he finally did graduate, His teacher told him to continue learning on his own and keep developing his skills how he saw fit. Ever since then Tenchu has strived to push himself to his absolute limits, and get as powerful as he could possibly get, to be like his grandparents were: Elite ninja of Konoha.

[b]Combat Style:[/b] Tenchu is mainly an up close and personal Taijutsu fighter. Occasionally he may decide to throw some nintai into the mix, but he is primarily an expert in unarmed fighting. If he is kept at bay, he relies on his katon to whittle his opponents down.

[b]Strong Fist Style[/b]

The Strong Fist Style has a single goal in mind: overpower. The style requires above average physical prowess and muscles trained and prepped for extraneous battles and exercises. The style’s main target is the external body, inflicting blow upon blow, whittling away the opponent’s stamina while keeping the user’s own at peak. The techniques themselves are relatively simple, but require precise muscle memory to accurately place attacks efficiently.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b]

[b]Jutsu:[/b]

Strong FistShow [b]*Leaf Gale[/b]

D-Rank Taijutsu

With the intention to disrupt, the user analyzes the opponent's movements. The user then angles a leg below or above a charging target's center of gravity. With a strike to an unprepared or vulnerable area, the user attempts to knock their opponent off balance as a means to interrupt the target's attack or set up for another attack of their own.

[b]*Dynamic Action[/b]

D-Rank Taijutsu

As a lengthening distance is commonly a weakness of many close range fighters, the principle of [b]Dynamic Action[/b] aims elliminate the option of retreat. In this technique, the user focuses on advancement in attempts to lock the target from creating distance. In a linear movement, the user "pushes" the target back with a flurry of strikes and kicks. As the attacks may generate "knock-back", the user makes the appropriate movements to keep the foe in range

[b]*Dynamic Entry[/b]

D-Rank Taijutsu

In this technique, the user builds movement and speed in order to bridge the gap between themselves and a distanced target. After collpasing an appropriate distance, the user then looses a form of distraction, like a thrown object, in order to waive the target's attention. The user then leaps with their momentum, delivering a strong kick to bridge the rest of the distance.

[b]Leaf Upper[/b]

C-rank Taijutsu

This moves primary focus is putting the target into the air for follow up techniques. The user will get within range of the target, and attempt to uppercut the enemy in their chin, sending them skyward. The target flies in the air, going up one meter for each strength point the user has over the target. The user then follows the target into the air to follow up with other techniques.

[b]Leaf Hurricane[/b]

C-Rank Taijutsu

This technique is meant to close the gap between the user and the target with a powerful hurricane kick. The user leaps into the air, performing a few rotations before hitting the target with a roundhouse kick. The buildup of the technique makes it faster and stronger, but much less precise, increasing the users strength and speed by 1 by one and decreasing the users tai by 2 for the strike.
KatonShow *[color=orangered][b]Fire Element • Flame Bullet Technique[/b][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the needed hand seals, the user focuses Katon chakra into one of their hands. This causes a fireball to form in the palm of their hand. They can then throw the fireball the same as they would any other projectile. If hit, the fireball causes light burning, barely a first-degree burn. If not thrown within two posts, the ball will dissipate into the air. The fireball typically only travels 20 or so feet before burning out.

*[color=orangered][b]Fire Element • Cauterization Technique[/b][/color]

D-Rank Iijutsu

After performing the needed hand seals, the user concentrates Katon chakra into one of his fingers, forming a tiny flame. They then place their finger on an minor wound, no longer than 6 inches and no wider than 1/2 inch, drawing theirfinger across the wounded flesh. After a period of 1 post and a great deal of pain, the wound will be cauterized.

[color=orangered][b]Fire Element • Hands of Flame[/b][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the needed hand seals, the user focuses Katon chakra into his hands. The chakra, when focused, causes their hand to form flames around their hands for a small period of time, lasting for roughly three posts. The chakra is not actually on the user's hands, therefore any handgear remains undamaged. Attacks made with the hands can cause first-degree burns upon contact, giving a taijutsu user an edge in battle.

[color=orangered][b] Fire Element • Great Flame Bullet Technique[/b][/color]

C-rank Ninjutsu

Prerequiste: Fire Element • Flame Bullet Technique

After performing the needed handseals the user places their palms together by their dominant side. The user then builds a large amount of Katon chakra between their hands, forming a large fireball in their hands. They can then shoot the ball at a target by thrusting their palms forward. If hit, the fireball hits with a strength of 5, causing second degree burns and searing the opponents flesh. This jutsu flies with a speed of 6 for 50 meters before dispersing.

[color=orangered][b]Fire Element • Firebird Strike[/b][/color]

C-Rank Nintaijutsu

After completing a short set of hand seals the user will flood their entire fist with Katon chakra. As they do this, their hand will be engulfed in an aura of searing hot flames that can cause up to second-degree burns on impact. The aura surrounds the users hands, leaving any handgear undamaged. The user then attempts to punch their target in their chin, performing a strong uppercut, but as they complete this initial attack the aura of flames engulfing the user’s hand will explode violently forward. The blast is very limited in range however, only extending forward about six inches and if it's not used within a post of initiating the technique it will fizzle out, wasting chakra. The blast is equal in power to three exploding tags. If executed on someone with less than six strength, this technique will blast them off of their feet, sending them flying upwards about twenty feet, and causing severe second degree burns.

[b]History[/b]
Tenchu was born to a normal family in Konoha, neither of his parents were ninja, proving to be meager members of the village, doing odd jobs to make their way, though his grandparents were among the top jounin of the village. Even as a child, the boy had a drive to become better at whatever he did, as was apparent by him always performing his chores as fast as possible, never once complaining that it was too hard or too much. Eventually, when he was 7, he began feeling that he was better than what he was doing, better than chores and meaningless work. it wasn't long after he had these thoughts that he learned from other village members that his grandparents, who he had never met, were among the elite of Konoha shinobi. From their his path was decided, and he enrolled in the academy at the age of 8.

Life in the academy wasn't too bad for Tenchu, as he proved to be an incredibly strong taijutsu user, due to his constant chores having hardened his body. One of his teachers took an interest in his physical prowess, and began teaching him the basics of Gouken Ryuu, the Strong fist style. Tenchu looked up to his teacher as a sensei of sorts, but it wasn't an official Senpai-Kohai relationship. It wasn't long after he began learning Gouken Ryuu that he discovered his affinity for Katon. It came so naturally to him that he began applying it to his fighting style just before he graduated from the academy. When he finally did graduate, His teacher told him to continue learning on his own and keep developing his skills how he saw fit. Ever since then Tenchu has strived to push himself to his absolute limits, and get as powerful as he could possibly get, to be like his grandparents were: Elite ninja of Konoha.

The rock is able to stay in place for up to three posts before crumbling, and can only be created within 5 meters of the user.

*[color=saddlebrown][Earth Element • Earth Clone][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding the ground around them with chakra, the user will cause a clone to materialize out of the ground. The clone is made of rock, and is quite strong and durable, but can only move within a quarter mile of the user. The clone is only able to use taijutsu attacks, and has the following stats: 1 Taijutsu, 4 Stamina, 2 Strength, and 1 Speed.

*[color=saddlebrown][Earth Element • Stone Shield][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: [Earth Element • Rock Shield]

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding the ground around them with chakra, the user will raise four boulders, each being three feet by four feet by two inches, out of the ground, surrounding the user.
Henrin TaijutsuShow ~Tripod – Swap the Film

E-Ranked Taijutsu

Due to the stance having a weakness of the leg that they are balancing on one leg, this style disallows for simple leg sweeps to function. Whenever a leg sweep is incoming, the clan member jumps up and over the attack, then switches the foot that they are balancing on, while evading the attack.

~Tripod - Swap Kick

D Rank Taijutsu

Prerequisite: Swap the Film

Using Swap the Film, the user will perform hop up to avoid the intended leg sweep. However instead of merely switching legs, the clan member will perform a downward kick at the offending leg in an attempt to hinder the opponent’s movement.

~Tripod - Snap Kick

D Rank Taijutsu

DotonShow *[color=saddlebrown][Earth Element • Rock Shield][/color]

E-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding a portion of earth with chakra, the user will cause a large piece of rock (2 feet x 3 feet x 1 inch) to rise from the ground. The rock is able to stay in place for up to three posts before crumbling, and can only be created within 5 meters of the user.

*[color=saddlebrown][Earth Element • Earth Clone][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding the ground around them with chakra, the user will cause a clone to materialize out of the ground. The clone is made of rock, and is quite strong and durable, but can only move within a quarter mile of the user. The clone is only able to use taijutsu attacks, and has the following stats: 1 Taijutsu, 4 Stamina, 2 Strength, and 1 Speed.

*[color=saddlebrown][Earth Element • Stone Shield][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: [Earth Element • Rock Shield]

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding the ground around them with chakra, the user will raise four boulders, each being three feet by four feet by two inches, out of the ground, surrounding the user.
Henrin TaijutsuShow ~Tripod – Swap the Film

E-Ranked Taijutsu

Due to the stance having a weakness of the leg that they are balancing on one leg, this style disallows for simple leg sweeps to function. Whenever a leg sweep is incoming, the clan member jumps up and over the attack, then switches the foot that they are balancing on, while evading the attack.

~Tripod - Swap Kick

D Rank Taijutsu

Prerequisite: Swap the Film

Using Swap the Film, the user will perform hop up to avoid the intended leg sweep. However instead of merely switching legs, the clan member will perform a downward kick at the offending leg in an attempt to hinder the opponent’s movement.

~Tripod - Snap Kick

D Rank Taijutsu

Prerequisite: Swap the Film

This attack is a simple in nature, while being approached by the opponent, the clan member will hop up. During the hop they will not only switch legs but bring up the one they were standing in on a snap kick aimed at the opponent's head.

			Shigekuni unbuttoned his white mandarin shirt as he set it aside, with the rest of his equipment. His first new teammate, Henrin Kiyori, had insisted on training since both of them had a lot of ground to cover if they planned to prove themselves in the Chuunin Exam. It was a bit odd having a person he could go into hardcore training with since  most times he trained alone. As he stood there in the Henrin training area, he started stretching his arms and legs.

"[color=#95BD4F]Before I start in on any jutsu, I was thinking of trying to do work on some muscle building exercises. I'll need you to climb on my back while I do push ups.[/color]" Shigekuni stated as he started stretching his back. "[color=#95BD4F]Of course if you have a better idea, I'm all ears.[/color]"

The Genin had a plethora of jutsu he could tap into once he finished his muscle exercises, he just hoped the training ground would be able to take it. Shigekuni didn't like the idea of working to rebuild the training grounds within the clan compound, but he could always view it as training and exercise.

Shigekuni unbuttoned his white mandarin shirt as he set it aside, with the rest of his equipment. His first new teammate, Henrin Kiyori, had insisted on training since both of them had a lot of ground to cover if they planned to prove themselves in the Chuunin Exam. It was a bit odd having a person he could go into hardcore training with since  most times he trained alone. As he stood there in the Henrin training area, he started stretching his arms and legs.

"[color=#95BD4F]Before I start in on any jutsu, I was thinking of trying to do work on some muscle building exercises. I'll need you to climb on my back while I do push ups.[/color]" Shigekuni stated as he started stretching his back. "[color=#95BD4F]Of course if you have a better idea, I'm all ears.[/color]"

The Genin had a plethora of jutsu he could tap into once he finished his muscle exercises, he just hoped the training ground would be able to take it. Shigekuni didn't like the idea of working to rebuild the training grounds within the clan compound, but he could always view it as training and exercise.

			As Kiyori and Shigekuni approached the Henrin training ground, Kiyori was making a mental list of everything she intended to train today, almost tuning out the world around her. This was her first real training session with a partner, and she wanted to make sure everything went according to plan, so she didn't seem like a weak link. As they arrived at the grounds, Kiyori began doing similar stretches, especially on her legs. Shigekuni wanted to work on his strength first, and Kiyori had the perfect technique in mind to practice while standing on his back. [color=slategray]"That's fine, i can stand on your back and practice swapping my feet in my base stance. I should be able to maintain balance and cushion my landing enough that I don't snap your back in two. Just let me know when you're ready, and i'll hop on."[/color]

It was slightly embarrassing to admit that her leg swaps weren't very good, as it was a base technique for the Tripod style. She only hoped Shigekuni didn't know that, as she was pretty sure he had little to no knowledge of the Henrin's Taijutsu. Still, it worked out all things considering, Her partners strength training gave her the perfect opportunity to solidify this basic movement.

			Shigekuni finished his stretching and nodded to his partner as he balanced himself on his toes for a second before leaning forward, letting himself fall over. Catching himself before he truly smacked into the ground, Shigekuni immediately went into doing push ups at a steady pace. He didn't feel much of anything while working himself up and down, counting out through muffled breaths every time he completed a push up.

After he got himself up to twenty he elevated his voice a little, "[color=#95BD4F]Go ahead and get on.[/color]" He got out before continuing his count. He braced himself for the new weight that would be on his back in a few moments as he kept his pace, wondering how long he'd be able to keep his pace as he worked his body up and down. Shigekuni had long since known the benefits of doing pushups, as they were a common exercise from the academy, but he'd never challenged himself by forcing weight on his back to increase the load his arms would be dealing with. Then again it wasn't just his arms he was working during push ups.

The whole point of push up exercises were to work the pectoral muscles, triceps, and anterior deltoids. He'd also heard they were capable of ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, various muscles along the underside of the arm, and a person's midsection in general since you had to keep your body rigid as well. If anything, Shigekuni would increase the benefits to those other parts of his body by having Kiyori standing on his back and applying changes in weight distribution with her Taijutsu training.

The Genin knew the benefits of working his upper body and only hoped that this idea paid off and didn't just wind up hurting his back as he continued to push himself up and down against the ground while awaiting his partner's contribution to his training.

			As her partner began stretching and doing some regular push ups to get used to the motion, Kiyori took the base Henrin stance, Setting up the equipment. as she stretched her right leg to a side kick position and extended her arms as if she were about to fight someone, she began practicing the leg swap. Hopping from one leg to the other while maintaining the same pose of a side kick wasn't an easy thing to do, it was essentially switching from a right hand dominant stance to a left hand dominant stance. Kiyori was ambidextrous, but it was still a difficult transition to make.

Once her partner was used to the basic push ups, it was time for her help to come in. She swiftly hopped on his back, landing between his shoulder blades so as not to cause lower back problems. She would have to be very careful not to apply too much pressure while swapping, she didn't want to break her partner's back. As shigekuni continued his push ups, Kiyori continued her leg swaps, starting with high, slow jumps and slowly increasing the speed while decreasing the height, getting faster and faster, until her supporting leg only left the ground for about a second. This exercise helped her get better at regulating her balance faster. As every moment counts in a fight, the faster she could perform this technique, the better off she would be.

This basic taijutsu was something that most Henrin knew long before they joined the academy, it was the simplest of the Tripod techniques. More importantly, it was something Kiyori needed to commit to muscle memory, something she had to be able to do without even thinking, a completely reactionary action. She did it over and over again, each time regulating her stance as fast as possible. Being on top of Shigekuni's back added a whole new level of difficulty to doing the technique, as it made it feel like the ground beneath her was moving up and down. She had to learn to compensate for Shigekuni's movements, easing into it when he was coming up, and dropping a bit faster as he descended. As a result, she was getting a lot better at swapping her stance. As shigekuni drew close to finishing his Exercise, Kiyori was finally starting to feel confident in her swaps, as though it were almost second nature to her at this point. Shigekuni gave her the okay, and she dismounted his back, performing a quick front flip while landing on her left leg in her basic stance before dropping back to a regular standing position. [color=slategray]"Good, i'd been meaning to do that for a while, and you gave me the excuse to do it. What's next?"[/color]

Due to the stance having a weakness of the leg that they are balancing on one leg, this style disallows for simple leg sweeps to function. Whenever a leg sweep is incoming, the clan member jumps up and over the attack, then switches the foot that they are balancing on, while evading the attack.

			Shigekuni kept a steady pace as he brought himself up, then dropping back down with his nose mere centimeters from the ground. As he started to move up again he could hear his part coming up to him and he kept himself braced for the extra weight she was about to put on top of him. Kiyori wasn't much more, but it was enough to make him slow his pace a little as he readjusted himself to coop with it.

Little did he know that what she had planned would be more than just simply balancing herself on his back. He hadn't really anticipated that Kiyori would be rapidly shifting her stance from one leg to another. It was almost like she was trying to kick or stomp on him, trying to push him back to the ground as he pushed up, mind you the girl wasn't as strong as Shigekuni, but she wasn't making it easy either.

Every time he counted off a push up he grunted with the impact of her feet against his back as the Henrin Genin start to gradually increase her pace over time. As Shigekuni performed each push up, he tried to keep himself steady as the girl picked hers up, in the end it would look more like his pace was slowing down to ensure he didn't get rammed into the ground by accident. As his pace slowed, it became more deliberate and enforced as he went from your regular push ups to building steady and deliberate movements with his arms. Each time he shifted his body down or up, his arms started using more and more of their fibrous tissue to enforce each movement.

Every time he dropped himself down close to the ground he could feel his muscles tightening accordingly in order to keep him from simply falling face first into the ground and possibly slamming his nose in some painful manner. Pushing himself away from the ground, he brought himself up and felt a burning sensation start to creep up his arms as he knew his arms were going to need a break after this was done otherwise he was gonna have a hard time moving his arms. However as he was getting close to concern, the weight on his back lifted as the girl stated she was finished with her training.

Shigekuni almost thanked his lucky stars but now he needed a new way to challenge his arms with the extra weight gone. Pushing himself hard enough to make his upper body lift away from the ground, Shigekuni twisted one arm behind his back and repositioned the other, his fingers and palm quickly positioning themselves against the ground before he dropped down in a one handed push up.

"[color=#95BD4F]I'm almost done, give me a little time to finish some one handed push ups on each arm and we can continue.[/color]" Shigekuni grunted out every time he pushed himself back up and she would be able to hear him. As he struggled to not only produce push ups with one hand, he also struggled to maintain balance since he was working his his arm just as much as before. He could feel beads of sweat start to form on his forehead as he went up and down a couple of dozens times with one arm before giving a final push.

As he pushed himself up away from the ground, the extra effort he put into it allowed him to quickly swap arms as he started going into a set on his now slightly rested arm. Shigekuni managed to crank out a higher pace on his other arm now that it had less of a 'burning' sensation to it after giving it a moment to recover during his first set of one handed push ups. The Genin huffedd out numbers counting up as he raised and lowered his body at a pace that was almost equal to what he'd started with on both arms, quickly cranking out the last bit of what he had planned for physical exercise before he'd move on to training other things. As he cranked out the last push up, Shigekuni rolled over onto his back and let his muscles burn from the soreness that would in time turn into new found strength.

			Kiyori Continued practicing her newfound leg swapping prowess for a few moments before realized that Shigekuni was still performing push ups. When she took notice of his one armed training, she simply watched silently, admiring the genin's drive to push himself to new limits. [color=slategray][i]"This is how everyone should think, this boy really has the willpower to push forward through the pain."[/i][/color] Kiyori continued to watch as he finished his training and rolled over to rest, clearly exhausted and already feeling the pain in his arms. [color=slategray]"We can take a break if you want. You look pretty tired."[/color]

			Shigekuni shook his head, "[color=#95BD4F]I just need a moment to let my heart beat return to a rested state, then we can continue. Besides I have a technique to deal with my arms that I'll train next anyway. It's an iijutsu based numbing technique that will allow me to use my arms like normal without worrying about feeling pain.[/color]" After a while, Shigekuni got up off the ground as he moved his arms a bit, feeling the ache in his muscles. "[color=#95BD4F]Okay, what do you have next on your list?[/color]"

-----------Training Begin-------------

Shigekuni took a moment to go through the list of techniques in his mind until he started to remember the specifics about his Raiton Numbing technique. Bringing his hands together he went through a dry run for the hand seals he was about to use, forming each one slowly and deliberately. It also let him work out some of the ache in his arms before he started really going at forming the hand seals at his regular pace to try and see how well he'd manage.

As he went through each seal, he eventually hit the last one then let his arms drop to his sides. Letting his arms rest a moment, he then brought them back up as he formed the seals again, this time at a one-eighth increase to his speed. Once he finished he started again, this time at one-fourth his regular speed. Then at half, three-fourths, and finally forming the seals at his regular speed.

After two more dry runs at regular speed, Shigekuni thoguht it was time to throw chakra into the mix and see how well he did in distributing it. Bringing his hands together once more, he could feel his body molding the chakra as it started to course up into his hands. Finishing the last seal he poured chakra into his hands, but alas it was too much and it sparked out, almost like a miniature bolt of lightning that zapped his hands.

Shigekuni jumped around, grasping his hand as he swore up a storm. He jumped around, stomped his feet, and took several audiable deep breaths through clenched teeth before he suppressed himself back to his usual demeanor. Shaking his hand and trying to get the feeling back in it, Shigekuni looked over at Kiyori. "[color=#95BD4F]I think I'm too used to offensive techniques, my hand is almost completely numb.[/color]"

			Kiyori nodded as Shigekuni stated that he would be fine after a brief rest. While he rested, she went through her mental list and decided that it was time for her to tackle something she wasn't experienced in. [color=slategray]"Well, everyone has to start somewhere, so I think i'll try a basic earth clone. Seems like a good place to start."[/color] She figured he wouldn't need her supervision to practice an Iijutsu technique, so she proceeded to start.

-----------Training Start-------------------

Kiyori took a few safe steps back from Shigekuni, in case something went wrong. She was a complete and utter novice when it came to her affinity, but as she activated her doujutsu, she quickly recalled the order of the hand seals for the Earth Clone. She was an adept at performing them at top speed due to her taijutsu training, but manifesting her chakra did not come easily. She ran through the hand seals over and over, at full speed every time due to the eidetic memory of her doujutsu, but she hesitated when she tried putting chakra into it, and her first attempt resulted in a tiny pebble raising from the ground.

Kiyori looked down, then looked at Shigekuni, with no facial change, but clear blush showing. [color=slategray]"Hold on, let me try that again."[/color] Kiyori again started going through the hand seals with the help of her doujutsu, but halfway through she stopped. After a brief pause, she continued to perform the hand seals at full speed, but she wasn't utilizing her doujutsu, instead choosing to perform it off of normal memory. It was something she would have to get good at, and fast, considering she wasn't always going to be able to rely on her doujutsu. She proceeded to continue performing her hand seals, over and over again, perfecting the movements and memorizing them completely.

Now came the true test. Kiyori took a deep breath, and focused her chakra, building it as high as she could. She performed the hand seals, each one perfectly timed and perfectly structured. As she stopped on the last seal, she released the chakra into the ground around her, and tried her absolute hardest to mold the ground up into a clone of herself. She could feel the earth around her buckle slightly as her chakra entered the ground, but no matter how much she concentrated, she simply couldn't make the ground raise up in the shape of her clone. She dropped her hands to her side and shook her head slightly. [color=slategray]"I can't seem to do it, i don't know what the problem is."[/color]

			"[color=#95BD4F]Keep practicing, that's about all I can tell ya. I don't use Doton so I'm not sure how it works.[/color]" Shigekuni said as he shook his hand. The numbness from his earlier attempt at creating a medically based numbing Iijutsu had backfired a bit as he had to give it time to give him feeling back in his hand. As the feeling went away at long last and Shigekuni could feel his hand again, flexed it a few times to make sure he got all the kinks out before he'd start again.

Bringing his hands up, the male Genin went through the seals in his head again and then thought back on the ones he'd used to make sure he'd gotten them right. Sure enough his memory and his past attempt lined up, showing he'd done the seals right and just over charged the jutsu somehow. As he came back to reality, the young teen started to slip his hands through the set of seals at just below the average speed her normally made hand seals, watching his fingers weave together and his hand shift around each other.

He would have been able to get the technique right this time had he now fucked up just then as his hands slipped into the wrong seal and he swore. Dropping his hands, Shigekuni shook them out again as he could feel his arms still aching and need of that numbing effect so he could get back to his training. Deciding to work his arms a bit he started to list off the seals as he clumsily massaged his arms, muttering each seal out under his breath till he was sure he had the order down in his head.

As he finished working on arm, he moved to the other and started mentally going over how he had over charged his technique the first time. Realizing that he used practically nothing but Offensive techniques that were meant to do harm, he must have powered it like he would have any other Raiton, thus making it blast his hand like it had. Shigekuni made a noise to himself, like he'd just realized that making basic iijutsu techniques was similar yet different in regards to other ninjutsu.

"[color=#95BD4F]Seems like control over how much chakra poured into a technique determines not just potency but also effectiveness as well.... I wonder if I've been over charging all my jutsu then?[/color]" Shigekuni stopped working his arm as he decided to try using a more exact amount of chakra instead of just pouring it into the technique. As he slipped his hands through the seals required for this technique, the male Genin felt his chakra molding within him.

Reaching the final seal for his technique, Shigekuni placed his hands together as he felt chakra surging up through his shoulders, then down through his arms before it reached his hands at last. Pulling his hands apart he could feel the chakra and see a faint crackling of Raiton energy flowing around his hands. The Genin brought one hand up to his aching arms and before he could touch his Raiton covered hand to his arm, sparks of energy lashed out, closing the gap as they made contact with his arm.

Everytime a tiny crackle of Raiton licked across his skin, he could feel his arm getting numb until finally the ache was gone. Of course he couldn't feel his arm either, but that was kind of the point of a numbing technique. Moving his arm, Shigekuni discovered he still had mobility in it, just no feeling. As he brought his other hand up to touch his other, still aching arm, the Genin watched as the technique flickered out from his outs.

"[color=#95BD4F]Maybe I didn't use enough chakra that time.[/color]" He said to himself before he started redoing the hand seals. Upon reaching the last one, he watched the energy spring up around his hands again before touching his arm. Like the first, the aching sensation faded away and then soon afterward, all sensation faded. Shigekuni raised his other hand and examined it for a minute before it flickered out like before. "[color=#95BD4F]Or maybe I can only get one use out of it, perhaps I'll have to stick to just condensing the energy into one hand and going from there.[/color]"

----------Training End------

"[color=#95BD4F]Well that's one down for me, how you doing with yours?[/color]" Shigekuni asked Kiyori as he waited to see if the numbing effects would last.

			[color=slategray]"I have problems utilizing my Doton chakra it seems, i haven't quite grasped it."[/color] Kiyori had to keep searching for a way to tap into the earth, or she would never be able to make use of her affinity. She took a break for a moment and watched as Shigekuni figured out how to make his Iijutsu. Her Shutter eye still open, she would have the seals of his jutsu memorized forever, though she didn't really need to know them. She did however replay the scene a few times, to maybe get a feel for how He harnessed his affinity. Then it dawned on her. [color=slategray]"I have an idea, let me try something."[/color]

------------Training Start----------------

Kiyori began the process of building her chakra, something that never came quite easily to her. General ninpou weren't quite so bad, but her affinity alluded her. Nevertheless, she would continue to practice this jutsu and get it right if it killed her. As her chakra reached a good level, She went through the hand seals of the Earth Clone jutsu, and upon finishing the final seal, Kiyori forced her chakra downward, pushing it down through her body into the ground around her, saturating the earth with her chakra. Soon after, she began trying to mold the earth through her chakra, shaping it into her image. She felt the ground beneath her shift and move, trying hard to bring her chakra up from the ground in front of her. She envisioned herself reaching up and pulling herself up from underneath the ground. Finally, her chakra sprang up from the ground, and a hand emerged from the ground in front of Kiyori. The momentary victory caused her to lose control for a brief moment however, and the hand quickly broke apart into simple dirt and rocks.

[color=slategray]"Well, that was better than my previous attempts at least. Now I think i'm getting the hang of this, one more try."[/color] Kiyori was sure she could make this jutsu work this time, she just needed to hone her technique a bit more. She began once more performing hand seals, but she focused on each specific seal rather than blow through it as fast as possible, taking a bit longer, giving herself more time to build her chakra as high as she could. She needed to slow down and focus, rushing herself was probably not the way to do this. As she finished and landed on the final seal, her chakra hit it's absolute peak. She finally released her chakra, and it felt like it was rushing from the tip of her head all the way down to her feet. It flooded the earth beneath her, molding the earth, shifting rocks and dirt around beneath the topsoil. As it filled the ground, this time Kiyori focused on the ground in front of her, and envisioned the hand from before springing from the ground. She had something to work with now, seen that it was possible to create a clone from the earth in her image. That assurance had payed off in the end, as from the ground in front of her a hand sprang forth once more, followed by another hand. The hands pulled the rest of Kiyori's clone from the ground, which now stood before her. It almost felt like she was looking into a mirror. [color=slategray]"Alright, I think i've got a feel for the earth now."[/color]

The hands pulled the rest of Kiyori's clone from the ground, which now stood before her. It almost felt like she was looking into a mirror. [color=slategray]"Alright, I think i've got a feel for the earth now."[/color]

			[color=slategray]"Okay, gives me a chance to actually learn something defensive with this technique. And remember, I literally just got a grasp on Doton, try not to blow me up too much."[/color] Kiyori wasn't exactly confident in her ability to use defensive Doton, but it was what the affinity specialized in, so perhaps everything would work out.

---------Training start-------------

Kiyori would attempt a very simple technique, one of the most basic of Doton jutsu. She had just wanted to start with a clone because it was similar in feel to the basic clone jutsu. This however, was a defensive technique, and required a bit of a different mindset. She went through a quick recollection of the hand seals using her doujutsu. Being such a basic technique, it wasn't too complicated to memorize, so she grasped the hand seals fairly easily. She first ran through the hand seals slow and dry, to get a feel for the order of the seals before trying it for real. considering this technique was basically just a simple rock shield, she hoped it wouldn't be too hard to perform, though her track record at current wasn't very good. Nevertheless,   she began trying the technique for real, building up her chakra as she performed the few hand seals of the simple jutsu. As she ended on the final seal, she forced her chakra into the earth beneath her once more, similar to before. Instead of trying to make a hand though, Kiyori focused on forcing the ground up straight in front of her, in the shape of a small slab of sort.

The ground quaked and buckled, but unfortunately she was still pretty inexperienced at this, and therefore undershot the chakra amount required for the jutsu, creating a tiny sharp point in the ground, no more than 3 inches tall and definitely not thick enough to be considered a shield. [color=slategray]"Huh. Still some work to do it seems, I can't even seem to manifest a basic defensive technique."[/color] Kiyori wouldn't let the failure discourage her though, she was pretty confident she had underestimated the chakra required for the technique, and that was an easy problem to fix. She began running through the seals again, building up a fairly decent amount of chakra this time, hopefully more than enough to fuel the jutsu in question. As she ended on the final seal, Kiyori once again imbued the ground with her chakra, focusing on an area of the ground about a meter in front of her. This time her jutsu took the shape she desired, as she witnessed the earth raise up in front of her about 3 feet tall and 2 feet wide. It was only an inch thick or so, but what could you expect from such a basic technique? Still, she wasn't quite sure it would defend against whatever Shigekuni was planning to do, considering it was a C rank technique according to him. As her doujutsu turned itself off, her eyes needing to take a break, she took a quick look at her clone and came up with a safer alternative.[color=slategray]"Maybe you should aim for my clone actually, this barrier seems kind of... weak."[/color]

			Shigekuni knew the hand seals for the technique he was about to use, it was just a stronger version of the D Rank he created shortly after graduating from the academy. The premise was so simple t was almost laughable since anyone could do it really. It was an exploding Raiton technique that detonated on impact with the force of three exploding tags at least. What Shigekuni needed to truly work on was the potency of the technique.

As he watched Kiyori work on her shield, he began forming the hand seals to create his own technique. As Raiton chakra course through him, he closed one of his hands as if he was gripping something and a bristling rod of energy sprang to life in his hand. Unlike the D Rank version which looked more like a rod of lightning that was on the verge of breaking apart into various bolts of energy, this version seemed more define in form, almost looking like a large arrow made of lightning chakra. As he held the technique in his hands, the Suna Genin felt the technique had no heft to it, almost weighing nothing as it was comprised entirely of chakra. Pulling his arm back, the Genin chucked the arrow upward into the air.

Once it reached a peak distance of what looked to be close to 10 meters away, the arrow exploded as currents of Raiton crackled through the air from the explosion. "[color=#95BD4F]Looks like the distance the thing will travel has doubled, but the explosion was maybe less than a single tag a best. I need to maintain the range and increase potency, that should get me the results I need. Might need to see about penetration power too, it is Raiton after all.[/color]" Shigekuni remarked to himself quietly before lowering his gaze and looking at Kiyori. As she mentioned trying his technique on her clone instead of a weak shield, Shigekuni nodded. "[color=#95BD4F]Might wanna back up, There might be some shrapnel from the clone going boom.[/color]"

Shigekuni started forming his hand seals again, letting Raiton chakra surge up from his core and travel down his arm into his hand. As he finished his last hand seal configuration, Shigekuni gripped at the air again and the same large arrow of Raiton burst into existence as its energy bristled about, especially where Shigekuni was holding the technique. During the creation process, Shigekuni had poured a little more chakra into the technique in order to give it more 'oomph' as it were.

Pulling his arm back, the Genin hurled the Lightning Arrow at the earth clone of Kiyori. As it traveled forward, the arrow sank into the clone and pierced through it's stomach like a fork into properly boiled potato. The arrow bristled there for a moment as Shigekuni straightened himself up and examined his handy work. "[color=#95BD4F]It didn't explode. Maybe all that extra chakra into strengthening the Raiton piercing properties instead.[/color]"

The Genin watched the clone fall apart into a pile of rubble as the Raiton Arrow fizzled out, leaving the Genin to ponder what he could do to correct his error in order make the jutsu work right.

Shigekuni started forming his hand seals again, letting Raiton chakra surge up from his core and travel down his arm into his hand. As he finished his last hand seal configuration, Shigekuni gripped at the air again and the same large arrow of Raiton burst into existence as its energy bristled about, especially where Shigekuni was holding the technique. During the creation process, Shigekuni had poured a little more chakra into the technique in order to give it more 'oomph' as it were.

Pulling his arm back, the Genin hurled the Lightning Arrow at the earth clone of Kiyori. As it traveled forward, the arrow sank into the clone and pierced through it's stomach like a fork into properly boiled potato. The arrow bristled there for a moment as Shigekuni straightened himself up and examined his handy work. "[color=#95BD4F]It didn't explode. Maybe all that extra chakra into strengthening the Raiton piercing properties instead.[/color]"

The Genin watched the clone fall apart into a pile of rubble as the Raiton Arrow fizzled out, leaving the Genin to ponder what he could do to correct his error in order make the jutsu work right.

			Next up for Kiyori was an advanced version of the basic Doton jutsu she had just learned. She wanted to stick to the basic jutsu that everyone was taught for the time being, until she felt confident to learn her own Doton techniques. This jutsu would require a lot more chakra than the previous technique she had just learned, but if done correctly may be able to protect her from Shigekuni's Raiton technique. She put her hands together and began focusing her chakra, building it up inside of her, focusing on her tenketsu. She wished that she had an easier time building chakra, but assumed it would come with the training. She proceeded to start performing the seals from the original E ranked jutsu, then added a few extra seals after the original end of the first. This was required to bring out more power in the technique, as it also required more chakra to use effectively. When she finished the final seal and pushed what chakra she had into the earth, she focused her chakra upwards through the ground, putting as much force into it as possible. However, as she expected, she hadn't mustered enough chakra to fully create the jutsu, and as the earth rose from the ground, halfway it just stopped. The boulder that was created was only half complete, then, as Kiyori released the hand seals, the boulder fell back to the ground in a heap of dirt and pebbles.

[color=slategray]"It appears I didn't use enough chakra, the technique was only about half way complete. But it felt like that was as much chakra as I could muster. How problematic."[/color] Kiyori seemed to have difficulty building her chakra to high levels, as if she didn't truly feel the chakra pulsing inside of her. This was an obstacle she would have to overcome if she was to be a ninja of any decent measure. She could do nothing but try again, watching as shigekuni was having trouble of his own. Perhaps it wasn't just her that had issues controlling her affinity, maybe it was just something to adjust to. She began giving the Stone shield jutsu another go, putting her hands together and trying once more to conjure chakra for the technique. This time was different though, she closed her eyes and tuned out the world around her for a moment, focusing inward, on her tenketsu. Finally, as she did this, she truly felt her chakra well up within her this time, higher than any previous attempt. And it continued to build, higher and higher, as though she had just risen to a new plateau of chakra manipulation. Kiyori had not felt so much chakra before, it was an incredible feeling, as though she had finally discovered her problem.

With that in mind, she proceeded to start performing the hand seals for the original Rock shield, while adding the additional seals at the end to increase the power of the technique. She ran through each individual seal, while simultaneously focusing her chakra downward towards her feet. After landing on the final seal, Kiyori pushed the intense amount of chakra down, into the earth, saturating the earth beneath her. Kiyori then concentrated on the ground, and with a surge of chakra, the ground beneath her shot upwards. To her left, right, and front, a large boulder began materializing from the ground up, slowly drawing the dirt and rocks beneath it into one solid mass. The boulders were of a good thickness, hopefully strong enough to stop at least some D rank techniques. Kiyori came to a relaxed state, and examined her jutsu to see if her efforts had paid off. The boulders were pretty solid, all things considered, she was quite pleased with herself. [color=slategray]"Well, i'm glad I finally seem to have overcome my chakra manifesting issue, I just had to really get a feel for it I suppose. I think another part of it was realizing that it wasn't just me having issues controlling my chakra, watching you tinker with your jutsu helped me become aware of that fact. Hopefully i'll be able to tackle the rest of my Doton techniques with a little more confidence. Why don't you try fine tuning your jutsu on these boulders, I want to see how well they hold up."[/color] Kiyori took a few steps away from her technique as she said this, she knew they were reliable, but not against a C rank technique.

			Shigekuni nodded to Kiyori as he started forming the hand seals he needed for his technique again. He started with the Rat and as things progressed he brought it to an end on the Tiger hand seal as his chakra surged forth from the core of his being and slipped into his hand as he grasped at yet another lightning arrow. He had altered a seal of two in the production this time to train and change those variables in the hopes that it would be what he needed.

Gripping the Raiton Ninjutsu in his hand, Shigekuni made sure that the Henrin Genin was out of the way before he started taking aim at his target. As he brought his arm and aimed, he held the Raiton arrow level with his neck and took a few moments to practice the motion he'd use to throw before actually pulling his arm back accordingly. As his body twisted, his left arm acted as a counter weight to his throwing arm. Once he reached the peak position to release the technique, he let his grip loosen as the Raiton arrow sailed through the air and proceeded to sink into the stone defense Kiyori had created.

Barely a moment after it entered the rock, the arrow exploded violently, sending crackling bursts of Raiton outward along with shrapnel from the Henrin's Doton technique. Shigekuni examined the distance and knew it was more than his original D rank version of the technique and figured that he could test the improved version in a moment as he was satisfied with the explosion. If anything, the technique had performed to expectations this time around and also given him an idea on how to keep working to practice it.

OOC: 817/800 words for C Rank Lightning Arrow

Shigekuni left out a breath as he looked to his training partner and nodded, "[color=#95BD4F]Well, that covers that. I might work with that technique a bit just to get the hang of it though, after all that's what practice is for. Even if we get the jutsu right on the first try we should still practice it a few times just to be sure, right?[/color]"

			Kiyori nodded, [color=slategray]"Yeah, your probably right, but I want to work on some more Taijutsu. I can handle it myself though, i'll just use a clone to practice."[/color] Kiyori wanted to learn some more of her Henrin Taijutsu, going back to the basics of her leg swapping technique. The beauty of the E ranked technique, Swap the film, was that it could be more than just a defensive swap of the leg. If one was skilled enough, it became a way to anticipate and react to attacks with one of their own. This was what Kiyori would be practicing with her clone, as she performed a few hand seals and brought another earth clone from the ground in front of her. The clone stood at attention, ready to begin throwing kicks and punches at her so that she might practice finding her opening.

Kiyori took the Tripod stance once more, lifting her leg and raising her arms into the air. Then, as the thought crossed her mind, her clone began throwing punch after kick in the same stance as Kiyori. Her doujutsu wasn't active, so she couldn't precisely recall every detail of the move in question, but it wouldn't matter too much, Kiyori's clone was so slow she easily had time to react, as she deflected some of the clones weaker punches with her hands and swapped her leg every time she saw a sweep coming. The clone was pretty easy to read, being as slow as it was, but that was the point, she needed to get used to doing this move regularly before she could get it in combat. As she saw another leg sweep coming, Kiyori saw her oppurtunity and, as she switched legs, she stomped her other foot down as hard as possible, attempting to break her clone at the knee. Her first attempt failed as she landed on the ground with a hard thud, and the clone took a readied position once more. Her timing was a bit off, but the actual maneuver was solid, she had a pretty good grasp on the technique itself.

She motioned the clone to continue it's assault, throwing more punches and kicks at the girl for her to dodge and deflect. As Kiyori began swapping her legs again, the clone threw yet another slow leg sweep out. This was her chance, as she stomped down on her clone's kneecap, almost breaking the knee in two, pinning it beneath her foot for a moment before she performed a quick backflip off of her now crippled clone, which then turned back to rocks and dirt. [color=slategray]"Okay, that was pretty easy, what do you have planned next Shigekuni?"[/color]

The clone was pretty easy to read, being as slow as it was, but that was the point, she needed to get used to doing this move regularly before she could get it in combat. As she saw another leg sweep coming, Kiyori saw her oppurtunity and, as she switched legs, she stomped her other foot down as hard as possible, attempting to break her clone at the knee. Her first attempt failed as she landed on the ground with a hard thud, and the clone took a readied position once more. Her timing was a bit off, but the actual maneuver was solid, she had a pretty good grasp on the technique itself.

She motioned the clone to continue it's assault, throwing more punches and kicks at the girl for her to dodge and deflect. As Kiyori began swapping her legs again, the clone threw yet another slow leg sweep out. This was her chance, as she stomped down on her clone's kneecap, almost breaking the knee in two, pinning it beneath her foot for a moment before she performed a quick backflip off of her now crippled clone, which then turned back to rocks and dirt. [color=slategray]"Okay, that was pretty easy, what do you have planned next Shigekuni?"[/color]

			As Kiyori went about practicing her own Taijutsu for a bit, Shigekuni was already returning himself to his jutsu training. Going over what he'd seen and done, he found a few things about that might come in hand not just for one technique, but all of his techniques. The last time he'd attempted to create the Raiton Arrow technique, he had swapped out a few hand seals and discovered that not only did the amount of chakra need tweaking, but the configuration of hand seals being altered helped produce a more viable explosion.

"[color=#95BD4F]So graduated techniques don't just use the same seals with a few extra tacked on the end, they can be altered to better improve the creation process and molding of chakra. Interesting, I wonder if this applies to all techniques that have stronger versions of themselves or did I somehow make some kind of breakthrough?[/color]" Shigekuni thought aloud as he he scratched his chin. He doubted he was pioneering some new method, after all chakra and Ninjutsu have been around for longer than the villages. Perhaps he was just stumbling upon it by accident, if anything he'd need to do research on the matter later to cement this theory properly.

Deciding to resume his refinement of his newest C Rank Raiton technique, the young Genin started slipping his fingers into the first seal. Using the last set of seals he'd done for his explosive Raiton, he went through the line up he'd used and on the last one, Shigekuni gripped at the air and sure enough a Raiton arrow burst into existence. Taking aim at the sky, he chucked the Ninjutsu technique into the air and watched it travel upward before it exploded with the strength of three tags like before.

Even with his alteration to the jutsu's seals and such, the range was still a solid 10 meters like he wanted. Now all he had to do was learn how to balance out the chakra usage so he wasn't wasting copious amounts every time he made one. As he stared up at the place the the explosion had once been, thoughts about how to modify and reconfigure his Ninjutsu skills went through his head.

Sure, Shigekuni had above average control to most of his fellow Genin but that didn't mean he was better at much else. He still had much to learn in terms of Ninjutsu and this was the place to start. He closed his eyes and went over everything he'd learned back in the academy about Ninjutsu, recalling the five basic affinities, shape manipulation, nature manipulation, the twelve basic hand seals, chakra molding exercises, application of Ninjutsu into Taijutsu. Opening his eyes slowly, he realized that this was most, if not all, basic knowledge.

"[color=#95BD4F]Base knowledge.... and here I thought I actually knew something for a change. This is all just the ground work, the advanced stuff must get learned at times like this. Alteration of hand seals into a new configuration series in order to properly create a stronger technique.[/color]" Shigekuni lowered his head and rubbed the bridge of his nose, not liking the idea that even after all the stuff he's learned and trained, it was all base knowledge for beginners. There was libraries more that he'd have to sift through it he truly wanted to comprehend Ninjutsu in depth.

As Kiyori asked what he intended to do next, the Genin shrugged. "[color=#95BD4F]I'm good to do more of about anything... You wouldn't happen to have a C rank Defense tech you would happen to need trainign with, would ya?[/color]" If anything, this would be his chance to test his hand seal configuration theory a bit more in depth.

			[color=slategray]"I don't think i'm quite skilled enough to do something of that power. I'll create a few more boulders for you to destroy, while i practice some more Tai with my clone."[/color] Kiyori quickly went through the seals of her Stone Shield jutsu, creating the same 3 boulders from before, then stepped away about 15 feet. Feeling safe at this distance, She proceeded to create yet another earth clone and begin practice on another Leg swapping Henrin technique

-----------------Training Start----------------------

Kiyori took the base Henrin stance once more, bringing her right leg up and her arms to a fighting position. She then commanded her clone to walk about 20 feet away, and prepare for a charge. Being used to already being in range for combat, Kiyori hadn't really experienced someone coming towards her in such a fashion, but she knew that there would be times when it happened. This technique was her answer for that kind of situation. essentially, Kiyori was to perform a leg swap when her clone came in to attack, bringing up her previously supporting leg in a kick against her enemy's skull before landing on her other leg. It was a simple maneuver to perform, but doing it in a combat situation may prove a bit more difficult.

As she readied herself, the clone began it's approach, moving about as fast as a clone made of heavy rocks could. The path of movement was easy to predict, as Kiyori waited for the clone to come close enough for her attack. As the clone got within about 5 feet, Kiyori lept into the air, and as she brought her left leg up to kick the clone in the head, her clone actually managed to duck the blow, delivering a punch square into her stomach, sending her back a few feet due to her being in the air.

Kiyori let out a quick gasp for breath, having the wind knocked out of you by yourself wasn't a fun experience. As she righted herself, however, she found that she was okay to continue, the damage was minimal at best. She has been caught off guard by the clone's movements, but she would get it right this time. The clone began putting distance between them once more, as Kiyori took her stance again. She watched the clone carefully this time, analyzing it's movements closely. As the clone began it's approach once more, Kiyori tensed her muscles in anticipation for the swap she would perform. She knew exactly what to do, it was all about reading the attack and anticipating where the enemies head would be as she switched legs. The clone once again got within 5 feet, and with a surgeon's precision, Kiyori lept above the leg kick the clone sent out, delivering a snap kick straight across the clone's shoulders, putting a large dent in the clone's skull before it fell to the ground and turned to dirt. [color=slategray]"Alright, thats taken care of now. How comes your technique Shigekuni?[/color]

			As Shigekuni waited for Kiyori to create the boulders again so he would have new targets to aim at. As she worked on making them, the young male Genin felt a tinge in his arms as the numbing technique was beginning to wear off. Deciding to take care of it before his arms got too far out of control, Shigekuni started forming hand seals before touching one of his arms then doing it all over again, save for the fact that he touch his other arm on the second go. Feeling his arms go numb again, he was thankfully he'd decided to try and train that Raiton Iijutsu technique first before moving on to bigger things.

Turning his attention back to Kiyori he saw her working on some kind of Henrin Taijutsu while her boulders were standing at the ready for him to continue practicing the perfection of his Raiton Arrow technique. Shigekuni cracked his knuckles before he started getting back to work, forming the hand seal arrangement he'd been concluded was the best set of seals for the technique. As he went through them at his normal pace, his hands coming together in the Tiger Seal before gripping at the air.

Raiton burst into existence as it shot out from where he was gripping, in the end he was lifting his arm to bring the lightning projectile up level with his eye line. Twisting his upper body and bringing his shoulder back, he brought his free hand up and used it like he'd been taught when hurling something akin to the projectile he was currently holding. In one fluid motion, he twisted his body, loosing the projectile at just the right time in his swing to make it soar at the boulders.

The Ninjutsu technique soared through the air briefly before it embedded itself into the Doton technique of his Henrin partner. The Arrow exploded barely even a moment of time after it sank int the rock, exploding with the strength of three tags while launching rock shrapnel about the surrounding area. "[color=#95BD4F]I think I've done all I can for that my training with this technique, but I've certainly gotten some insight in Ninjutsu. Makes you wonder why they don't hold extended courses that would be optional for us all to take. One handed seals, reconfiguration and rearrangement, and so much more. I'll need to assess all my techniques more closely in the future, this kind of thing makes one ponder how complex the advanced techniques can get.[/color]"

--------Training Ends--------

Shigekuni let out a breath and shook his head as he still couldn't believe how much he still had to learn for Ninjutsu before he'd truly understand it like the more experienced shinobi in the village. "[color=#95BD4F]Right now, there is a handful of things I could train. A Shock Fist technique that I'm capable of performing, some Raiton techniques meant to enhance the body.... I have a few experimental techniques, but they're not even ready for practical testing since they're just ideas. Aside from some standard Ninpou, I'm not entirely certain what else I could try and learn right now.[/color]"

As Shigekuni waited for Kiyori to create the boulders again so he would have new targets to aim at. As she worked on making them, the young male Genin felt a tinge in his arms as the numbing technique was beginning to wear off. Deciding to take care of it before his arms got too far out of control, Shigekuni started forming hand seals before touching one of his arms then doing it all over again, save for the fact that he touch his other arm on the second go. Feeling his arms go numb again, he was thankfully he'd decided to try and train that Raiton Iijutsu technique first before moving on to bigger things.

Turning his attention back to Kiyori he saw her working on some kind of Henrin Taijutsu while her boulders were standing at the ready for him to continue practicing the perfection of his Raiton Arrow technique. Shigekuni cracked his knuckles before he started getting back to work, forming the hand seal arrangement he'd been concluded was the best set of seals for the technique. As he went through them at his normal pace, his hands coming together in the Tiger Seal before gripping at the air.

Raiton burst into existence as it shot out from where he was gripping, in the end he was lifting his arm to bring the lightning projectile up level with his eye line. Twisting his upper body and bringing his shoulder back, he brought his free hand up and used it like he'd been taught when hurling something akin to the projectile he was currently holding. In one fluid motion, he twisted his body, loosing the projectile at just the right time in his swing to make it soar at the boulders.

The Ninjutsu technique soared through the air briefly before it embedded itself into the Doton technique of his Henrin partner. The Arrow exploded barely even a moment of time after it sank int the rock, exploding with the strength of three tags while launching rock shrapnel about the surrounding area. "[color=#95BD4F]I think I've done all I can for that my training with this technique, but I've certainly gotten some insight in Ninjutsu. Makes you wonder why they don't hold extended courses that would be optional for us all to take. One handed seals, reconfiguration and rearrangement, and so much more. I'll need to assess all my techniques more closely in the future, this kind of thing makes one ponder how complex the advanced techniques can get.[/color]"

--------Training Ends--------

Shigekuni let out a breath and shook his head as he still couldn't believe how much he still had to learn for Ninjutsu before he'd truly understand it like the more experienced shinobi in the village. "[color=#95BD4F]Right now, there is a handful of things I could train. A Shock Fist technique that I'm capable of performing, some Raiton techniques meant to enhance the body.... I have a few experimental techniques, but they're not even ready for practical testing since they're just ideas. Aside from some standard Ninpou, I'm not entirely certain what else I could try and learn right now.[/color]"

			[color=slategray]"Well, I have no problem calling it for today, we've learned a lot so far. On the other hand, I could always practice more with my Doujutsu."[/color] Kiyori was feeling tired, but she had the drive to continue going if Shigekuni did, there was always more ground to cover and never enough time it seemed. She still had Fuuin she wanted to learn, more Henrin taijutsu, more Doton, and of course her Doujutsu itself to work on. She would leave it to Shigekuni to decide, as she stood patiently awaiting his answer.

			Kiyori decided today that she would go to a different training ground than normal, usually sticking to the Henrin grounds whenever she decided to train. She wanted to get out of the norm for a little bit and practice in an area where anyone was allowed to train and practice their technique. It would also help her to experience some new terrain for a change, considering today she would be mainly focusing on her Taijutsu, involving some basics, some Henrin specific moves, and possible some custom ambush tactics. As she arrived at the training grounds in question, she took the time to note that there were some training dummies off to the side, as well as a bench to rest if need be. Clad in her Tan Mission outfit, mask and all, Kiyori walked over to the training dummy and began practicing some basic strikes to warm up before she would tackle the new stuff for today.

Kiyori decided today that she would go to a different training ground than normal, usually sticking to the Henrin grounds whenever she decided to train. She wanted to get out of the norm for a little bit and practice in an area where anyone was allowed to train and practice their technique. It would also help her to experience some new terrain for a change, considering today she would be mainly focusing on her Taijutsu, involving some basics, some Henrin specific moves, and possible some custom ambush tactics. As she arrived at the training grounds in question, she took the time to note that there were some training dummies off to the side, as well as a bench to rest if need be. Clad in her Tan Mission outfit, mask and all, Kiyori walked over to the training dummy and began practicing some basic strikes to warm up before she would tackle the new stuff for today.

			(Nefarious Training #3: Deftness. 150/1000)

Jiigo had been wandering. he'd failed his chuunin exam, to the surprise of just about everybody, and now was looking for a way to get stronger. His puppets had been outmatched, because Jiigo had been outmatched as a puppeteer, and also as an engineer. He needed to improve himself so that he could improve his puppets. he'd been looking over the fight again and again, trying to find a way he could have improved himself.

If nothing else, it had truly been a humbling experience for the genin. And now he was sitting alone in the training grounds, idly toying with Nefarious' armor, hoping to find something that would make the puppet better, that would make him stronger, hoping for some kind of new innovation. And there he sat, feeling rather glum and down on himself when a stranger approached. He doubted that he had gone unnoticed--she was here to train, and ninja aren't inattentive--but it seemed she was willing to let Jiigo keep to himself, if he wanted.

Jiigo watched her for a little bit, observing her warm-up. She was clearly very skilled with Taijutsu--enough to kick the crap out of Jiigo if she wanted. He actively winced at the thought. He knew he couldn't keep up with this girl. And somehow, that made him angry. Angry at himself, and angry at the stranger, and angry at Nefarious, and angry at himself again. He hadn't earned the prestige he'd gotten as a genin. He wasn't the strongest. He was just some mook who'd gotten lucky one too many times. And it was time people came to know it. Getting his ass kicked by a Taijutsu user seemed to be a good way to start.

And so Jiigo approached. [color=#cc8800]"Hey."[/color] Jiigo's voice sounded defeated already. [color=#cc8800]"I can help, if you felt like training on something that moved."[/color] Nefarious rose from his shoulder, hovering in front of the genin. [color=#cc8800]"Practicing some new moves? Maybe I can help you learn to hit true with them."[/color] From there, he let the girl decide.

			As Kiyori was in the middle of her warm ups she noticed there was someone else at the training grounds. This wasn't something out of the ordinary of course, but she couldn't help but notice that he was working on what looked to be a puppet, some sort of sphere or something. It was the first time Kiyori had actually seen a puppeteer outside of the academy's basic puppets for demonstration to students. The boy working on the puppet, however, looked to be a bit down on his luck, as though something bad had happened to him. At first Kiyori thought to leave the boy alone so as to give him space, but after some working on his puppet, he got up and walked over to Kiyori, and in a low, almost depressing tone, offered to let her beat up on his puppet, or perhaps even him, in order to train on a moving target.

[color=slategray]"That's nice of you, but why would you want me to hurt you like that? I'm all for it, just as long as you know what taijutsu training entails."[/color] Kiyori's voice was as cold as ever, but showed a hint of sincere concern. Kiyori wanted him to be sure that he was okay with what was about to take place, as she didn't want to break the boy's puppet, or worse, him. [color=slategray]"I'll give you a moment to decide how you want to do this, considering you'll be the one on the defensive and I don't want to hurt you too bad."[/color]

			[color=#cc8800]"Nah, not me, just Nefarious here."[/color] He tried to smirk, but the arrogance didn't rise higher than his lips, never touched his eyes. [color=#cc8800]"These spikes of his have some nasty surprises, and if you're not deadly accurate with your taijutsu, he can punish you for it. This will be a good way to help you reign yourself in without holding back, right? I know I could use some extra practice anyway."[/color] Jiigo realized that with all the work he'd done with his puppets, he had been all about offense. He'd never really considered defending himself or his puppets. He'd always just arrogantly assumed the opponent wouldn't have a chance to get a hit off, and with the exception of Jiigo's newest puppet, whom the genin was not yet ready to use as anything more than a cape, he had no defensive ability whatsoever. How could he have been so stupid?

It didn't matter. He could work on it now. Maybe working against something actively attacking his puppets would give him some ideas about how to keep them safer from attacks like the ones they'd take. As of now, all of Nefarious' chains were coiled up inside of it. It was a mere ball of spikes. [color=#cc8800]"Name's Jiigo, by the way. Jiigo Samata."[/color]

[color=#cc8800]"Nah, not me, just Nefarious here."[/color] He tried to smirk, but the arrogance didn't rise higher than his lips, never touched his eyes. [color=#cc8800]"These spikes of his have some nasty surprises, and if you're not deadly accurate with your taijutsu, he can punish you for it. This will be a good way to help you reign yourself in without holding back, right? I know I could use some extra practice anyway."[/color] Jiigo realized that with all the work he'd done with his puppets, he had been all about offense. He'd never really considered defending himself or his puppets. He'd always just arrogantly assumed the opponent wouldn't have a chance to get a hit off, and with the exception of Jiigo's newest puppet, whom the genin was not yet ready to use as anything more than a cape, he had no defensive ability whatsoever. How could he have been so stupid?

It didn't matter. He could work on it now. Maybe working against something actively attacking his puppets would give him some ideas about how to keep them safer from attacks like the ones they'd take. As of now, all of Nefarious' chains were coiled up inside of it. It was a mere ball of spikes. [color=#cc8800]"Name's Jiigo, by the way. Jiigo Samata."[/color]

			[color=slategray]"I see. Okay, this gives me a chance to practice my approach, as well as my accuracy. Also, I wasn't aware that people named their puppets, this little ball is named Nefarious? And it's weapons are spikes huh? Okay, I think i can deal with that. And nice to meet you, My name is Kiyori, Kiyori Henrin."[/color] Kiyori had a great interest in Puppetry and the like, but she didn't have anywhere near the kind of control needed to use a puppet. It would be something she had to work on, but for the time being she would continue to train her taijutsu.

----------Training start ---------------

Kiyori warned Jiigo before she started that the technique she would practice was for approaching purposes, unlike most of the Tripod style of moves. [color=slategray]"This technique is all about covering distance while taking my stance at the same time, so be prepared."[/color] With that, Kiyori began walking back a ways, putting about 20 yards of distance between her and Jiigo's puppet, Nefarious. She wasn't used to taking her stance in mid air, nor was she used to fighting outside of her stance, as Kiyori had been using the Henrin's signature fighting style since she was in the academy. But that was the point of this technique, the Tripod style's major weakness was being on one leg, which made approaching enemies difficult. This technique was meant to be used as a gap closer, as the user would run at an enemy, performing a straight kick into the opponents stomach, while maintaining balance by leaning their upper body back to counteract the forward momentum, then land on their supporting leg to assume the Tripod stance.

This was what Kiyori would now attempt, as she began running full speed towards Nefarious. The entire time she was running, she never once took her eyes off the puppet, watching for any sort of spike or chain or something to come at her. As she got within range of the puppet, she lept into the air in a straight kick with her right leg extended to hit the puppet. As she was about to make contact, Kiyori saw one of Nefarious's spikes jut out, and reactively dropped her kick and simply fell to the ground to avoid stabbing her foot. As she got up and dusted herself off, she wasted no time in putting more distance between them, going to the same starting position. [color=slategray]"you weren't kidding when you said i had to be deadly accurate. That was pretty close. I'll give it one more try."[/color] Kiyori prepared herself for the straight kick once more, getting ready to make her dash at Nefarious. She would have to take great care to not kick straight into a spike, but she guessed it would come with practice. As she began running at the puppet once more, Kiyori would try her best to not kick the same area as before, she really didn't want a foot full of spike. Once she was again within range, She jumped into the air and again performed a straight kick at Nefarious. She saw no spike this time, and the kick connected, but it was one of her weakest kicks ever as Nefarious didn't even budge. Kiyori landed on her left leg in a battle ready Tripod stance before returning to normal. [color=slategray]"I hope i didn't hurt your puppet, but thank you for helping me with this technique, it's much more fulfilling to train against a moving target that can fight back."[/color]

OOC: 479/900 words for spoilered Henrin technique
Jutsu to be learnedShow ~Tripod - Straight kick

C Rank Taijutsu

This technique is not performed on one leg like most, instead the clan member can use this while approaching their opponent. The kick is performed when the user gets within range, they will lean their upper body back to counter the act itself thus maintaining their balance. Once they've leaned back the user will bring one leg up and forcefully thrust the bottom of their foot forward into the stomach or lower back of their target.

			The path that the previous had taken was one that was easy to follow, given the map that they had drawn for the Jounin.  They had done their best to mark the spots where they had had interactions with the ninja.  There was no guarantee where he would show up though and they had warned him over and over that he needed to be careful.  His attacks had been well planned and precise, aimed at terrifying them, but e was good enough to top his jutsu from really hurting them.  Someone with that much control was dangerous.

He would need to be on a sharp lookout for signs of the man that was haunting the woods.  Preparation before heading off into the woods would be wise.  There was no telling when danger might arise and without prep work, the fight might be over quicker than the ninja cared for it to be.

SpoilerShowBasically, talk about what you did before entering the woods, and then rp walking through, being wary, blah blah

			The path that the previous had taken was one that was easy to follow, given the map that they had drawn for the Jounin.  They had done their best to mark the spots where they had had interactions with the ninja.  There was no guarantee where he would show up though and they had warned him over and over that he needed to be careful.  His attacks had been well planned and precise, aimed at terrifying them, but e was good enough to top his jutsu from really hurting them.  Someone with that much control was dangerous.

He would need to be on a sharp lookout for signs of the man that was haunting the woods.  Preparation before heading off into the woods would be wise.  There was no telling when danger might arise and without prep work, the fight might be over quicker than the ninja cared for it to be.

SpoilerShowBasically, talk about what you did before entering the woods, and then rp walking through, being wary, blah blah

			Ha. Ryoga gave little thought to his employers warnings. The fact that these ninja had strength in numbers and still lost was a sign of their weakness. Ryoga was amply prepared for any encounter he may face along the way, his sword at his side the only equipment he ever needed. Without a shred of fear, he would enter the forest a little before noon to begin the hunt.

As he traveled throughout the forest, he would carefully scan every tree top and any possible hiding places he may have noticed, such as tall grass or perhaps a body of water, attempting to leave absolutely no stone unturned. He also kept a close eye on his backside, not wanting to be ambushed from behind by his prey. Ryoga loved being in these situations, it was one of the few things that brought him happiness. His only complaint about his mission was it was to be a non lethal takedown. The thought brought him to a sigh, why not just kill the bastard and end the problem permanently? However, Kirigakure specifically said not to kill, and he would obey his orders as always. He would pause to take a break by a small river, but not before sensing the immediate area for any signs of a pulse. If nothing was felt, he would rest by the river for a few minutes, then continue on.

Jutsu usedShow Feel the Pulse

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Control 6

After doing the needed hand seals, the user channels their chakra into the surrounding area, travelling at a speed equal to the user's control, up to 30 yards away. This allows the user to sense nearby blood pulses. At this level, it doesn't allow for pinpoint movements, but it does allow for the user to sense direction and distance.

			The immediate would hold no sign of life, aside from the Shinobi.  Due to the nature of the woods, there would be no way to track a random set of footprints and have any luck at all with it.  The chances of following the trail of the hiding ninja was as likely as following the trail of a bear.  He was doing well though and he was heading in the right direction, gaining ground, and getting close to the area that the man had attacked the young ninjas.  At the river, he would be about sixty yards from the location of the attacker.  The man was not a patient one and it would be wise for the Shinobi to be prepared.  The man sat high in a tree, waiting for someone to get close enough to play with.  A very strong, very agile, bored individual was never a safe thing.

			Ryoga was clearly enjoying this hunt as a smile crossed the mans face for a moment. After pausing for a brief moment by the river, he would proceed to check a bigger area with his stronger tracking abilities. If there were still no signs of life, he would proceed deeper into the forest, checking every so often for life in the area with his lower jutsu, so as to not waste chakra before the fight.

			((I'm confused as to why you are using one of your blood techs when you don't have any of his blood?  I do believe that is how that jutsu works.))

The man high in the tree decided that waiting for the ninja to reach him was much too boring.  He slipped out of his tree, his feet making a solid thud on the ground beneath him.  His neck cracking, he stood quietly, knowing that the ninja would be along shortly.  He had several knives visible along his belt and he took two out, tossing them in the air, almost juggling them. He would be quite the sight to come in on, and maybe that was the point.

			As the man lept from the tree, Ryoga quickly took notice of him, and everything about him. He heard his feet thud against the ground, saw him crack his neck, and witnessed him juggle a few knives as he stood in wait it seemed. Ryoga approached the man, standing about 30 feet in front of him, close enough to close the distance but far enough to dodge throwing weapons, which it appeared the man specialized in. [color=#DC143C]"So you're the one causing trouble in the forest i assume? Is attacking lesser ranked ninja your idea of fun, or are you just too weak to fight someone that matters?"[/color] Ryoga stood, hand on his hilt, ready for it to turn deadly at a moment's notice, but he wouldn't make a move just yet.

As the man lept from the tree, Ryoga quickly took notice of him, and everything about him. He heard his feet thud against the ground, saw him crack his neck, and witnessed him juggle a few knives as he stood in wait it seemed. Ryoga approached the man, standing about 30 feet in front of him, close enough to close the distance but far enough to dodge throwing weapons, which it appeared the man specialized in. [color=#DC143C]"So you're the one causing trouble in the forest i assume? Is attacking lesser ranked ninja your idea of fun, or are you just too weak to fight someone that matters?"[/color] Ryoga stood, hand on his hilt, ready for it to turn deadly at a moment's notice, but he wouldn't make a move just yet.

			The man grinned at his words.  He loved it when they tried to act smart and tough.  His knives stopped and were soon sheathed again, his hands empty.  "[color=peru]You gotta poke the baby bear before the mama bear comes running kid.  You're all they sent though?  I doubt you'll be any more trouble than the team of Genin that were out here.  And they were just pathetic.[/color]"  He turned his head to the side, spitting into the dirt, complete disrespect oozing from him.  He clearly thought nothing of the kid standing in front of him and that became even more clear when he covered his eyes with his hands and stepped his feet wide apart, and grinned again.  "[color=peru]Look, I'll even give you a free hit.  What you got?[/color]"

			Ryoga scoffed at the man's disgraceful gestures towards him. As if he cared who he was or what he thought. He was a target in his mission, nothing more. As such, he had nothing more to say to the man. As the man presented himself for a free shot, Ryoga would gladly take that opportunity. His mission stated that he couldn't kill his target, but that wouldn't stop him from crippling him how he saw fit. He quickly dashed towards his target, covering the distance between them in a matter of seconds, but keeping an eye out for a trap of some sort, as he could be luring him into something. if he managed to get to him, he would draw his blade and aim to break the man's kneecap with the side of his blade, placing his palm on one side and pushing forward with the hilt to shatter him at the knee, then resheathing as quickly as possible with his right hand, almost throwing it back into it's sheath.

Jutsu usedShow *Iaido • Beheading Draw

C-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 6 Speed

The user draws their katana with one hand and slams their palm into the back of their blade to increase the force behind the swing made in any direction. This works with blunted side of a sword, but it can also draw out their strength and the blade's cutting power in full to quickly slash apart obstacles. Re-sheathing after this technique may take a bit longer; the placement of the hands following this technqiue make it difficult to resheath properly.

*Iaido • Quick Sheath

D-Rank Utility Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 4 Speed

Through hours of practice the user has learned to quickly sheath their weapon with one hand. This allows the user sheath their weapon as quickly as possible, even if their other hand is not on the sheath.

			The man was expecting the sudden onslaught, expecting the Shinobi to not realize that getting the first move was not as important as getting the first hit.  It was why when Ry drew his sword the man was prepared, turning to the side and pushing himself into a back flip, kicking away the hilt of his blade with the sole of his foot, using Ry's own momentum to push himself further away.  A grin of enjoyment was on his face as he landed, his feet planted firmly.  "[color=peru]That was good, though predictable.  You need to be more...how do you say, discreet.[/color]"  As if to make his point as he finished talking, the man's seals were finished and his foot stomped the ground and he purposefully looked down as his feet as though to wait for his jutsu to take affect.

Whereas, instead, a sudden burst of katon would begin to erupt from the ground where Ryo was currently standing, covering about a 3x3 foot radius.  The fire was hot, enough to cause second degree burns if enough time was spent in the flames.  He was ready to react depending on  what Ryo did in response to the flames, that ever irritating smile still lit on his face.

			Ryoga was impressed with the man's ability to avoid his attack. He almost barked at the man out of spite [color=#DC143C]"Discretion is for the weak. You'll bleed like the rest."[/color] As he finished his retort, he saw the man finish some seals and stomp on the ground. [i][color=#DC143C]"Stomping the ground? Seems similar to one of my own techniques"[/color][/i]. No sooner had he completed his thought, He instinctively jumped backwards away from the burst of katon, performing his own seals and after landing and finishing these seals, stomping the ground. Moments after, a fountain of water sprang forth, enveloping a 3 meter area, and hopefully the katon with it. [color=#DC143C]"Your lucky i have to bring you back alive, or this would be so much quicker."[/color] Afterwards, he would move to the side of the fountain to establish line of sight with the man once more, and wait for his reaction.

Jutsu usedShow *Guardian Fountain

C-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Control Stat of 6

Requiring a slightly above average level of control, this technique generates a large amount of water as a defense mechanism. By performing a string of seals, the user will stomp and create a fountain of water from the ground that flows at a speed of five. The fountain is three meters in diameter and four meters in height. This technique lasts for three posts. All in all, this creates just over eight thousand cubic meters of water.

"[color=peru]Oh?  That's a veerrryyyy interesting piece of information that you probably shouldn't have shared.[/color]"  Telling an opponent that you couldn't kill him was essentially giving him the automatic upper hand.  A rookie mistake, and a costly one at that.  It gave the man the knowledge that no attack was going to be of deadly force, it allowed him to know somewhat the level of urgency he would need to move with to avoid an attack.  The look on his face only grew more confident as his mind quickly ran through all of this information.

As the Shinobi finished his seals, the man began running, easily expecting something to come from the ground.  His speed was intense and he was able to avoid the majority of the fountain, though it hit him towards the end of his run but he was able to use the momentum enough to be able to flip into the air and land solidly on his feet and palms, his hair falling around his face, now lightly damp.  He shook his head much like a dog, "[color=peru]Thanks, I needed a bath.[/color]"

Standing relatively close now, the man began threading hand seals, backing up very slightly.  As his seals would complete he would place both hands out in front of him, a large burst of wind blowing from his hands, pushing with a force of seven and cutting with a strength of five.  The man had to concentrate and could not perform any other techniques at the same time, though the wind could be controlled to a certain degree.  Though the jutsu could be canceled easily, the man wouldn't be able to move while he was controlling the wind.

			((Nah, its all good, i read your thread in the intro area about you having some stuff coming up, i totally understand.))

Ryoga hadn't really thought what telling his target that meant, but in the end he didn't really care. [color=#DC143C]"Believe me, It doesn't change the outcome of this fight. You're nowhere near as skilled as me, This will be over quickly." [/color] Ryoga would do everything in his power to keep himself from killing this man, but if it came down to a life or death scenario, he knew he wouldn't hesitate to off him in an instant.

As the ninja dodged the geyser Ryoga set forth, he was honestly surprised that it had hit him at all. A relatively weak defensive technique meant for producing water in a pinch, the geyser wasn't meant to actually hit the man, but rather engulf the Katon burst he caused. Ryoga made eye contact with the man, watching his every move so that he might counter with the water being produced by the fountain. [color=#DC143C]"I'm shocked that hit you at all, either you're slower than i thought or you're not paying enough attention." [/color]

No sooner had he finished saying "attention" the man made his move, stepping back and performing handseals. As he finished his seals, Ryoga saw the gust of wind leave his palms. He dashed top speed while performing handseals, making a dash to put the fountain between him and his target. at top speed, he was barely faster than the burst of wind following him, but it did still slash as his back a bit, ripping through his clothes and lashing his back with a few small gashes. It stung a bit, but he had experienced far worse.

As he put the fountain between them and finished his seals, He focused on the geyser, still gushing water, and put his hands into the water, morphing it into a large ball of water which then rolled towards the man at a speed of 7. The ball stood 4 meters tall, and had a diameter of 3 meters. Not wanting to waste time, Ryoga would proceed to dash around the other side of the fountain, away from the man's torrent of wind he hoped, and would then react to whether or not his prison engulfed the man as he planned.

Jutsu usedShow *Water Prison

B-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

By forming a string of seals, the user is able to spew a large ball of water that stands at three meters in diameter. This ball rolls at the target at a speed of seven. Should this strike a target, they will become engulfed within the sphere. However, if this manages to strike multiple targets, it will envelop them as well, up to a total of three prisoners. One can resist being pulled into the ball if they have a strength of seven or higher. The ball will roll thirty meters, regardless of whether or not anyone has been captured. Once inside, the targets will spin with the sphere and may cause dizziness, nausea and disorientation. The technique lasts for a total of five posts, rolling included, before bursting.

			OOC: Nah, its fine, i've been pretty busy myself, no problem. Also, i hope i didn't do too much.

[color=#DC143C]"Big talk from the coward running through the trees!"[/color] Ryoga yelled into the treetops at the man as he dodged his water prison. Ryoga noticed that the ninja seemed to have sped up after those seals he performed, but he still didn't think he was a match for his speed. As the man disappeared into the treetops, Ryoga scoffed as he performed a few handseals, then began feeling the trees above for his enemies pulse. He was sure that he was within 30 yards of him, and if he was right and felt his blood, he would perform a few additional seals to focus in on his specific signature. There was no catching Ryoga off guard, not as long as it bled.

The man approached him from above, getting closer and closer. Ryoga put his left hand on his sword and waited, ready for him to come at him. He hoped he didn't think he had the element of surprise. The man hung upside down behind Ryoga, and as he began to say something, Ryoga pulled his sword out with his left hand and stabbed it backwards behind him, Knowing exactly where the man was. If the man managed to dodge his stab, he would step forward a few steps and turn to face the man.

Jutsu UsedShow Feel the Pulse

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Control 6

After doing the needed hand seals, the user channels their chakra into the surrounding area, travelling at a speed equal to the user's control, up to 30 yards away. This allows the user to sense nearby blood pulses. At this level, it doesn't allow for pinpoint movements, but it does allow for the user to sense direction and distance.

Singled Out

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Feel the Pulse, control 6

After sensing someone through Feel the Pulse and adding a few additional hand seals, the user can focus in on a specific person's blood signature. The user hones in on this specific signature if it is within a 30 yard range, and begins to track it down.

*Iaido • Reverse Stab

D-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 4 Speed

By gripping their blade, the user draws their sword as if a dagger in an earth facing grip, but instead of attacking a target in front of them they will turn their sword mid-swing in an attempt to stab a target that is behind them.

			It was getting close to being time for him. He needed all the help he could muster, especially at this juncture. The Genin had managed to get some information on a handful of Genin that would prove to be his best shot at ensuring the success of his plans. As Tenjirou Shigekuni walked the streets of Sunagakure in the fading light of the setting Sun, he made his way to the third candidate's house, visiting each of them in the order he had been given the information.

Shigekuni looked up from his notes and saw he was standing before the Henrin compound. He'd heard the name before, yet he'd never heard about what the clan could do. He was about to find out as he assessed this Henrin Kiyori he was about to see. He was showing up to the meeting without prior introduction or warning so he was probably gonna be treated with a degree of distance he wagered.

As he entered the compound he looked around the front yard before he spotted an older member of the clan, possibly in their 30s. "[color=#95BD4F]Excuse me! I'm looking for a Henrin Kiyori. I need to a speak with her.[/color]"

"What's it pertaining to?" The man asked as Shigekuni thought for a moment before deciding to go with the direct route. "[color=#95BD4F]Recruitment. Just need to see if she's eligible and also available to join a team for the Chuunin Exams.[/color]" The man seemed to cringe as he nodded. "Yeah I remember those, I'll go get her. Oh, wait here please."

The man departed as Shigekuni waited in the front yard for the person to return with Kiyori or to hear the news about how she wasn't interested.

			It was getting close to being time for him. He needed all the help he could muster, especially at this juncture. The Genin had managed to get some information on a handful of Genin that would prove to be his best shot at ensuring the success of his plans. As Tenjirou Shigekuni walked the streets of Sunagakure in the fading light of the setting Sun, he made his way to the third candidate's house, visiting each of them in the order he had been given the information.

Shigekuni looked up from his notes and saw he was standing before the Henrin compound. He'd heard the name before, yet he'd never heard about what the clan could do. He was about to find out as he assessed this Henrin Kiyori he was about to see. He was showing up to the meeting without prior introduction or warning so he was probably gonna be treated with a degree of distance he wagered.

As he entered the compound he looked around the front yard before he spotted an older member of the clan, possibly in their 30s. "[color=#95BD4F]Excuse me! I'm looking for a Henrin Kiyori. I need to a speak with her.[/color]"

"What's it pertaining to?" The man asked as Shigekuni thought for a moment before deciding to go with the direct route. "[color=#95BD4F]Recruitment. Just need to see if she's eligible and also available to join a team for the Chuunin Exams.[/color]" The man seemed to cringe as he nodded. "Yeah I remember those, I'll go get her. Oh, wait here please."

The man departed as Shigekuni waited in the front yard for the person to return with Kiyori or to hear the news about how she wasn't interested.

			As the sun started to set in the village of sand, Kiyori began heading from the Henrin training ground back to her house. She had been training hard for the past few hours, and was quite exhausted. As she headed back to her house on the clan compound, she was caught by another Henrin clan member. She was familiar with him of course, but for some reason the man's name escaped her, though she could easily tell he was one of the older members, looking to be about 30 or so. "Kiyori, there's a young boy at the compound entrance looking for you, something about recruitment or something, I don't know." Before she could even respond the man took his leave. [color=slategray][i]"Well. That was rude of him. Still, why would someone be looking for me? how odd..."[/i][/color]

As Kiyori puzzled over this, she decided taking a shower and cleaning up could wait, she didn't want to leave her unexpected company standing in front of the compound. The front of the compound was at least a good mile from the training grounds she had just left, so she rushed over there as fast as her dainty legs could carry her. About 13 minutes later, She was within eyeshot of the compound entrance. She approached the only non-henrin standing in the front yard, a rather tall looking boy with short black hair and a sort of white jacket. She felt weirdly dressed now, as she was dressed in her tan desert camo outfit meant for combat, mask and all, having just come from training. Regardless, she approached the boy and started off with a simple introduction, in her usual monotonous tone. [color=slategray]"Hello, i assume you were the one looking for me? I'm Kiyori Henrin. Forgive the sweat and dirty clothes, you caught me as i was wrapping up my training and was about to go home and clean up. In any case, might i ask why you are searching for me in particular?"[/color] Normally Kiyori was more goofy than this, but given she had just met this boy, she didn't quite know how she felt about him yet.

			[color=slategray]"I see. The chuunin exams... I haven't even given them much thought yet, I only graduated a couple weeks ago. However, i'm a bit short on training partners, I could always use some help, and it's always a good idea to plan ahead. Unfortunately i don't meet the requirements for the test, being fresh out of the academy and all, but I have a lot of training to do before any of that."[/color] Kiyori knew that the most important thing right now was to develop her skills, she had a lot of ground to cover. However, Kiyori was really happy that someone was already trying to recruit her. she didn't know if it was because of her skill, or maybe this kid Just sucked at Taijutsu and needed a fighter. Regardless, the effort to seek her out showed he was serious.

[color=slategray]"wow, you've given this a lot of thought. You're pretty smart, thats good. And of course there's strength in numbers, but i'm happy just to have someone interested in me. Being a Henrin, i bring something to a fight that no one else can. Do you know anything of the Henrin?"[/color] The Henrin were the youngest of all of the clans, being only about 90 years old, so it wouldn't be too out of the ordinary if a genin Didn't know they're abilities yet. However, if Shigekuni didn't know, she would be happy to explain and demonstrate both her taijutsu specialty, and the famous Shutter Eye doujutsu.

However, Kiyori was really happy that someone was already trying to recruit her. she didn't know if it was because of her skill, or maybe this kid Just sucked at Taijutsu and needed a fighter. Regardless, the effort to seek her out showed he was serious.

[color=slategray]"wow, you've given this a lot of thought. You're pretty smart, thats good. And of course there's strength in numbers, but i'm happy just to have someone interested in me. Being a Henrin, i bring something to a fight that no one else can. Do you know anything of the Henrin?"[/color] The Henrin were the youngest of all of the clans, being only about 90 years old, so it wouldn't be too out of the ordinary if a genin Didn't know they're abilities yet. However, if Shigekuni didn't know, she would be happy to explain and demonstrate both her taijutsu specialty, and the famous Shutter Eye doujutsu.

Something dawned on him however as he had yet to introduce himself. He decided to wait until she was finished with her explanation instead of just randomly butting in. Still, With him as a Nintai and Ninjutsu use, he wondered what skill set she brought to the table and what affinities she used.

[color=slategray]"This is the basic Taijutsu stance of the Henrin. Almost every Henrin is an expert in Taijutsu, and also incredibly smart. My stance obviously leaves my leg open to sweep attempts, but our doujutsu helps us compensate for this."[/color] As Kiyori finished her sentence, she dropped her stance, and with a thought, activated her doujutsu as two red rings took the place of where the outer and inner edges of an iris would be in the black pit that was her eyes.

[color=slategray]"This, however, is what makes the Henrin so formidable. This is the Shutter Eye. Everything that our Doujutsu sees, it records, like perfect eidetic memory. We can later recall any information that our eye has stored, in fractions of a second. This makes us incredible Taijutsu experts, as we can record and study any move over and over again. It also makes us experts at, well, information storage. Rest assured, if my Shutter eye has seen it, you can always trust that what i'm saying is one hundred percent accurate. However, we can only keep it open for a while at a time, it needs a break every so often. There are members that have taken their doujutsu to the next level however, keeping it open permanently."

			[color=slategray]"Believe me, I would love to manifest Doton, but for some reason it eludes me. I have no idea what Shock fist is, but i assume it's some sort of nintai. And it's nice to meet you, You already know my name, But i'm Kiyori Henrin."[/color] Suddenly the thought dawned on her, as Shigekuni looked at the notes in his hands, that she had been recommended to this boy by academy teachers. She was curious what they had said to him about her, but she guessed it wasn't important.

As Shigekuni handed her the papers, Kiyori took a quick jot of them all with her Doujutsu, considering it was still on, then stuck them in her pocket. [color=slategray]"Sorry, impulse. If it's on i like to record as much as possible. Never know what might be worth remembering."[/color] Kiyori loved making use of her Doujutsu whenever possible, Having remembered a lot of her teachers lessons word for word, and seen many hand seals and jutsu on paper and in person. She was just as prepared to train as Shigekuni, having spent hours researching hand seal construction. She just hadn't put the time forth to figure out how to harness the earth. [color=slategray]"If you have time to spare, we could go back to my place and work this out. I just finished training, and the member you sent to me caught me as i was on my way home to shower and change."[/color]

The boy seemed to have everything in order, thinking 10 steps ahead in a long term plan. The more Kiyori thought about it, the happier she was the he sought her out, with such a sound strategy their chances at passing the chuunin exams would be much higher. [color=slategray]"Well, Doton does specialize in defense, but i'm not limiting myself to one or the other, i plan to diversify offense, defense and supportive techniques. Our Clan Taijutsu is called the Tripod style. As the name implies, the moves are named after photography, with the base stance being "Setting up the equipment". That was my one legged pose earlier.

[color=slategray]"Believe me, I would love to manifest Doton, but for some reason it eludes me. I have no idea what Shock fist is, but i assume it's some sort of nintai. And it's nice to meet you, You already know my name, But i'm Kiyori Henrin."[/color] Suddenly the thought dawned on her, as Shigekuni looked at the notes in his hands, that she had been recommended to this boy by academy teachers. She was curious what they had said to him about her, but she guessed it wasn't important.

As Shigekuni handed her the papers, Kiyori took a quick jot of them all with her Doujutsu, considering it was still on, then stuck them in her pocket. [color=slategray]"Sorry, impulse. If it's on i like to record as much as possible. Never know what might be worth remembering."[/color] Kiyori loved making use of her Doujutsu whenever possible, Having remembered a lot of her teachers lessons word for word, and seen many hand seals and jutsu on paper and in person. She was just as prepared to train as Shigekuni, having spent hours researching hand seal construction. She just hadn't put the time forth to figure out how to harness the earth. [color=slategray]"If you have time to spare, we could go back to my place and work this out. I just finished training, and the member you sent to me caught me as i was on my way home to shower and change."[/color]

The boy seemed to have everything in order, thinking 10 steps ahead in a long term plan. The more Kiyori thought about it, the happier she was the he sought her out, with such a sound strategy their chances at passing the chuunin exams would be much higher. [color=slategray]"Well, Doton does specialize in defense, but i'm not limiting myself to one or the other, i plan to diversify offense, defense and supportive techniques. Our Clan Taijutsu is called the Tripod style. As the name implies, the moves are named after photography, with the base stance being "Setting up the equipment". That was my one legged pose earlier. I can tell you more about it later though, and the true strength of the style."[/color]

			Shigekuni held his hand out as he nodded, "[color=#95BD4F]I'll need those notes back seeing as you won't need them with your eidetic memory and all. But yes, sparring later would be good, we can get a grasp of what the other can do and then try training new things. As for your diversty, I think we should plan more on specialization for now with our Ninjutsu skills. Doton makes great defense and Raiton is a potent offense, which when used in Shock Fist style can disable opponents easily. Shock fist is about disabling opponents using Raiton's numbing and paralytic abilities, at least that's the jist I get form it.[/color]"

Shigekuni sighed as he shook his head, "[color=#95BD4F]I still have a great deal to do in terms of training to get ready, that's the only problem I find with this Chuunin Exam. We practically have to push ourselves to the limit of being as strong as Chuunin before we even fight them and even then we can still lose since the Chuunin are capable of so much more it seems. But I suppose that's why I'm putting so much thought into the planning process, cause the more prepared we are as a team, the better a chance we stand. Still, I take it you're in on being apart of this team?[/color]"

			Kiyori nodded and handed back the notes to shigekuni, as she did a quick recap of the notes in her head. [color=slategray]"Not a problem. I train very often, if you ever want to train we can always use the Henrin grounds. it's where i do most of my training. I can think of a few Doton techniques i could use for defensive purposes, so that's not an issue, whenever you have time to train i'm ready, just be forewarned i'm less than average when it comes to my affinity as of now."[/color]

Kiyori was pretty impressed with her would be partner's ability to use nintai, she wish manifesting her chakra came that easily to her. [color=slategray]"So, what kind of things are you wanting to improve on before the chuunin exams exactly? you've planned this far, i'm sure you probably have a list ready for training days. Also, to answer your question, it benefits us both to do this, so of course i'm in."[/color] It was funny that Kiyori mentioned a list of techniques to train, because despite wanting to train, she hadn't really thought much about exactly what to train. She knew she wanted to learn her affinity and some more Taijutsu, but beyond that she would have to think outside the box for a while, really try to figure out what she would spend time learning.

			Shigekuni slipped the notes into his pocket as he listened to Kiyori. It seemed to Henrin training grounds would become their meeting spot in the future when needing to train techniques and the like. He would have to get together with her another time and figure out what he was going to do in terms of figuring out who their third member will be, but they could always talk about that later.

"[color=#95BD4F]Well I'm roughly a well rounded genin from what I hear, but I plan to train my Ninjutus skills enough to be of proper use in the exams, especially since I plan to pursue knowledge of something later. I'm assuming it requires considerable Ninjutsu prowess to use so I'll have to work on that for now.[/color]" Shigekuni cleared his throat as he stopped himself from going on a tangent about his stupid hopes and dreams about something that might not even exist anymore. "[color=#95BD4F]Anyway, I was intending to train my Raiton abilities since I have a theory on a way to enhance performance in various fields, be it strength or speed, flexibility or wit. I also have offensive Raiton to train and an idea fr some Raiton Iijutsu. Lastly I want to train some Shock Fist jutsu.[/color]"

			As she listened to her new partner explain what he had planned for the future, Kiyori thought for a moment on what she could learn. [color=slategray][i]"Well, i know i want to improve on my taijutsu, and i need to become at least somewhat skilled in my affinity. Some general Ninpou wouldn't hurt either."[/i][/color] As the thoughts went through her head, Kiyori listened to what Shigekuni had to say about increasing his Ninjutsu capabilities and plans for Iijutsu.

[color=slategray]"I could probably study some Fuuin as well, i had plans to memorize some basic seals at the library sometime soon. But these are all things that we can discuss later. You should come to my place sometime soon, i'm assuming that file on me has my address on it, right?"[/color] Kiyori was having fun discussing these things with Shigekuni, but she obviously had to wash herself soon, as she could tell she probably didn't smell too great. [color=slategray]"I'll be taking my leave, you can come by some other time and discuss these things. For now, I really need a shower. I'll talk to you soon Shigekuni."[/color] And with that, Kiyori turned and headed back to her house so that she might plan her jutsu and fix her hygiene issue.

As she listened to her new partner explain what he had planned for the future, Kiyori thought for a moment on what she could learn.

Some general Ninpou wouldn't hurt either."[/i][/color] As the thoughts went through her head, Kiyori listened to what Shigekuni had to say about increasing his Ninjutsu capabilities and plans for Iijutsu.

			Apologies for the lateness. This month's forum event shall be a Social Training Event; training socials are coming back into style. Praise be to the Admins! In all seriousness, training socials are being rewarded this month in doubles.

Whatever you train in a social with another person you get a coupon of equal value in addition to the jutsu you trained. You train a D-Rank jutsu, you get a free D-Rank Coupon. It's really that simple. Training a stat in a social will yield a choice; either a jutsu coupon of your choice (up to A-Rank) or a 5 Point Weapon Coupon.

Solo training threads do not count, socials only.
To keep this nice and fair to everyone, the 3 thread per character rule is being strictly upheld for this event. There will be very little yield to this.
Your training social needs to be started after September 1st to count. The rewards will count for those starting September 30th but for a VERY LIMITED TIME into the month of October. (Don't make us Admins banhammer your thread, we shall be very disappointed so please be responsible and don't try to cheat us.)For those currently in a training thread, any posts made September 1st and onward will be accepted, those before that, no.Rewards will be given at the END of the month and it is your responsibility to keep track of your own threads. Meaning, you do not post threads for your group and/or partner, you are posting them for YOUR character only. (Everyone posts for themselves)
If you are waiting for a re-activation and are certain you're going to see it through, you can participate but you won't get your rewards until the character is active once more.
Only the character you train with gets the coupons, they are [i]not[/i] transferable to others.
If you are training with someone but are not training something yourself, you don't get your partner's rewards.

[b]Jutsu Trained:[/b] Water Clone TechniqueShow*Water Clone Technique

C-ranked Suiton Ninjutsu

After performing the required seals, the user will be able to create clones made of water. Unlike a normal clone, the water clone has the ability to interact more with the environment due to it having physical substance. This allows the clone to carry out limited attacks on its target. The range of the clone is limited, only able to travel about fifty meters from the user. The user distributes a sufficient amount of chakra equally amongst their other clones, allowing them to use any C or D-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu the user knows.

Taijutsu – 1

Stamina – 3

Strength – 1

Speed – 3
Water VortexShow*Water Vortex

C-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: The intended target must be on top of water

This technique is meant to immobilize and capture a target without dealing any type of fatal blow. After performing the required seals, the user will churn chakra in a body of water. The water will then engulf the target, trapping them in a vortex about two meters in diameter. However, for this technique to be used, the user must be within five meters of the target when the vortex is initially created and must stand within one meter of the vortex after the target is caught. Once the target is inside, the user must hold the last seal and cannot use any other techniques. The technique lasts one post for every two points of stamina the user has. In order to escape, the target must have a strength higher than the user’s control and physically make their way out, or the user must be disrupted. Most shinobi would pass out after two posts due to a lack of oxygen. However, if a target possesses a stamina stat of six or seven, it would require three posts for them to pass out. Should the target possess a stamina stat of eight or nine, it would require five posts for them to pass out, but anything higher would allow them to resist passing out altogether.
Water Dragon ProjectileShow[color=dodgerblue][b]*Water Dragon Projectile[/b][/color]

B-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Water Dragon Projectile is a technique that uses the rushing force of water to cause devastating damage. By performing the required seals, the user will utilize a preexisting body of water in front of them before molding it into the form of a dragon head. Once it has been created, the user can launch the two-meter wide projectile towards a target at a speed equal to the average of their ninjutsu and control, with a maximum of ten. Following the head is a long body and tail, stretching nearly ten meters. This technique is able to travel up to thirty meters and is able to be maneuvered to an extent by the user. Up to three times the user may alter the course of the dragon, allowing it to complete a U-turn per alteration.

[b]Jutsu Trained:[/b] Water Clone TechniqueShow*Water Clone Technique

C-ranked Suiton Ninjutsu

After performing the required seals, the user will be able to create clones made of water. Unlike a normal clone, the water clone has the ability to interact more with the environment due to it having physical substance. This allows the clone to carry out limited attacks on its target. The range of the clone is limited, only able to travel about fifty meters from the user. The user distributes a sufficient amount of chakra equally amongst their other clones, allowing them to use any C or D-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu the user knows.

Taijutsu – 1

Stamina – 3

Strength – 1

Speed – 3
Water VortexShow*Water Vortex

C-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: The intended target must be on top of water

This technique is meant to immobilize and capture a target without dealing any type of fatal blow. After performing the required seals, the user will churn chakra in a body of water. The water will then engulf the target, trapping them in a vortex about two meters in diameter. However, for this technique to be used, the user must be within five meters of the target when the vortex is initially created and must stand within one meter of the vortex after the target is caught. Once the target is inside, the user must hold the last seal and cannot use any other techniques. The technique lasts one post for every two points of stamina the user has. In order to escape, the target must have a strength higher than the user’s control and physically make their way out, or the user must be disrupted. Most shinobi would pass out after two posts due to a lack of oxygen. However, if a target possesses a stamina stat of six or seven, it would require three posts for them to pass out. Should the target possess a stamina stat of eight or nine, it would require five posts for them to pass out, but anything higher would allow them to resist passing out altogether.
Water Dragon ProjectileShow[color=dodgerblue][b]*Water Dragon Projectile[/b][/color]

B-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Water Dragon Projectile is a technique that uses the rushing force of water to cause devastating damage. By performing the required seals, the user will utilize a preexisting body of water in front of them before molding it into the form of a dragon head. Once it has been created, the user can launch the two-meter wide projectile towards a target at a speed equal to the average of their ninjutsu and control, with a maximum of ten. Following the head is a long body and tail, stretching nearly ten meters. This technique is able to travel up to thirty meters and is able to be maneuvered to an extent by the user. Up to three times the user may alter the course of the dragon, allowing it to complete a U-turn per alteration.

Jutsu Trained: jutsuShowWind cutter

D-rank ninjutsu

After forming the signs,Kuro molds chakra into his hands until they are surrounded, faintly, by wind. The wind isn’t very strong, but it is capable of inflicting shallow cuts into the flesh of many common opponents. The strikes don’t get any stronger or faster just a edge like property. This jutsu lasts for three posts, or until the user stops it.

Jutsu Trained: jutsuShow
Creeping hold

C-rank Doton jutsu

By applying the hand signs and channeling chakra into the earth with his hands pressed against the surface, Rozan is able to manipulate the earth into latching onto his target, most times the feet but any limb will do, binding them to the earth. Because this is a sustained jutsu, the earth will start to creep up the targets limb, encasing it in stone but only to a certain extent. If the legs are grabbed it will creep all the way up to the wasit, making it that much harder to break free. If it's the arms, then it can cover up the targets face potentially sufficating them. It can be one or the other, but not both, and the creep takes a full post after contact to fully extend.  The hold's strength is the same as Rozan's control up to 7, but that's only while Rozan is constatnly giving the jutsu power, should he stop the strength would lessen to 4. The creeping effect can only happen so long as Rozan is giving the jutsu power.

			Ten Commandments of The LazyShow

1.   YOU'RE BORN TIRED AND YOU LIVE TO RELAX.

2.   YOU LOVE YOUR BED LIKE YOU LOVE YOUR BODY.

3.   IF YOU SEE SOMEONE RELAXING, HELP.

4.   WORK IS SACRED, DON'T TOUCH IT!!

5.   RELAX BY DAY, SO YOU CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT.

6.   WHAT YOU CAN DO TOMORROW, DON'T DO TODAY.

7.   WORK THE LEAST YOU CAN, WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, LET SOMEONE ELSE DO IT.

8.   CALM DOWN, NO BODY EVER DIED FROM RELAXING.

9.   WHEN YOU GET THE URGE TO WORK, SIT DOWN AND WAIT UNTIL IT PASSES.

10.  IF WORK IS HEALTHY, LET THE SICK DO IT!

			[color=#DC143C]"A partner? And you won't tell me who they are? And why is that?"[/color] Ryoga had a noticeably annoyed tone to his voice as he asked about the person that was to be accompanying him on his next mission. If there was one thing Ryoga hated, it was surprises, but for some reason, the man giving him his mission saw fit to hide this person's identity from him. [color=#5a70b3]"Look, I was told to give you your mission and to let your partner introduce themself, don't kill the messenger Ryoga. In fact, they should be here any moment, I sent for them as well. Just take a seat, they will be here shortly."[/color] The man seemed adamant in hiding his partners information from him, so Ryoga would simply take a seat in a chair inside the man's office and watch the door like a hawk, waiting to meet the person he would be working with on his next mission.

			No sooner had Ryoga taken to watching the door when it burst open and an outre, orange haired woman came leaping in while making the noise of a trumpet. "[color=#8B7765]Ba-ba-ba-ba -ba – - ba-ba-bom – - ba-ba-ba-ba – ba – - bom-bom-bom![/color]" She landed on both of her feet, quickly straightening herself while spreading her arms upward in a V shape as she looked to the ceiling dramatically. Needless to say, the woman had already painted herself as a loon in everyone's eyes by her entrance.

Alas, she wouldn't give a flying fuck in the end. It's not like she'd explain herself to anyone either, at least not someone that didn't warrant such an explanation. Lowering her arms as she move to place them on her hips, she looked around the room. She saw a red haired man in old timey dress and a ninja guy behind a desk. "[color=#8B7765]SO! which one of you is Ryoga?[/color]"

			As Ryoga began watching the door, it immediately burst open as an orange haired Toukai woman came into the room. Of course, he noticed she was a Toukai After her incredibly odd entrance, playing her own bugle and posing as if she was a hero or something. There was no way, no fucking way, the village decided to have them work together. But alas, as he was about to escort the woman out, believing she had the wrong room, she asked specifically for him.

[color=#DC143C]"Is this some sort of joke? Does the village seriously want me to work with someone like that?"[/color] Ryoga was talking specifically to the ninja behind the desk, as he simply couldn't believe that they would have him work with someone that appeared so... unrefined. He did take note of the incredulous amount of swords the woman was carrying on her side though, so perhaps her battle skills were up to speed, but so far her personality caused Ryoga to want nothing to do with her. [color=#5a70b3]"Look, I don't make the orders, I just give them out. If you want to complain, talk to the kage or something, thats not my department Ryoga."[/color] After raising hell to the man, he took one more look over to this Toukai woman, eyeing her up and down to assess her strengths and weaknesses, then simply took a seat and quietly thought to himself about how he would remedy this situation

			Kirio lowered her arm as she smiled contently with her entrance as Ryoga seemed to be miffed about something. It was quite amusing to watch as he couldn't believe he was paired with her, but Kirio assumed it was because she was gonna be such a joy to work with. At least she hoped that was the reason, she hated to think that he didn't wanna work with her. That'd just be another nail in the shoe of her day.... or something like that. Either way, the village deemed it so, meaning he was more than likely stuck with her.

Still, nothing like a training session to get to know your partner. 'Blood will out' as they say. But that day was not today. Today she would talk with this man, learn in inner most things and sample what his brain meats could create in the form of words. That's right, conversation was on the agenda for today. "[color=#8B7765]I see you're sufficiently excited about something. So tell me Ryoga, what do you bring to Kiri's collective of skills? I see you have a sword, but are you any good with it? It's not some massive over encumbering piece of shit so I assume you have no problems with the size of your penis. But you dress weird, why are you dressed like a weirdo?[/color]" She asked with a smile, her squinted eyes obscuring her most typical clan trait.

Still, nothing like a training session to get to know your partner. 'Blood will out' as they say. But that day was not today. Today she would talk with this man, learn in inner most things and sample what his brain meats could create in the form of words. That's right, conversation was on the agenda for today. "[color=#8B7765]I see you're sufficiently excited about something. So tell me Ryoga, what do you bring to Kiri's collective of skills? I see you have a sword, but are you any good with it? It's not some massive over encumbering piece of shit so I assume you have no problems with the size of your penis. But you dress weird, why are you dressed like a weirdo?[/color]" She asked with a smile, her squinted eyes obscuring her most typical clan trait.

			Ryoga was simply at a loss. What could he even say to someone as eccentric and looney as this person? She spewed on and on, like diarrhea of the mouth, asking about his sword and penis size and clothing in a constant mash of words flowing out of her mouth in a continuous stream. Ryoga gave the man giving him his mission a very evil glare, promptly causing him to get up hastily and nervously. [color=#5a70b3]"weeellll I think i'll let you to have some alone time, don't let me get in the way."[/color] As he said this, he quickly shuffled out of the room, past Kirio, and down the hall somewhere into the building. [color=#DC143C][i]"Great. Just leave me alone with this crazy woman that i know NOTHING about!"[/i][/color] Ryoga let out a long drawn sigh, and began sifting through what his "partner" just said.

[color=#DC143C]"Okay, let's start from the top. I'm Ryoga, I was trained by my father to fight with my katana, and a taught myself how to use Blood Release as a means of tracking, earning myself the title of Sanguine Stalker. I dress this way because i simply don't like Kirigakure's generic outfit, though i do wear it underneath my Kimono. And just what is wrong with wearing a Kimono? They're light, traditional swordsman clothes. Of course i don't use some giant sword, it would be useless and impossible to use with the style i was taught. And how about you? You haven't even introduced yourself, unless you call that distraction your entrance. What's with the incredulous amount of swords? I've fought with Toukai before, but none with 18 swords on their hips."[/color]

			"[color=#8B7765]Sooooooooo.....[/color]" Kiro seemed to start a statement then seemed distracted by something on the desk that once held the man that had been talking with Ryoga. She looked at him again and seemed to realize he was there once more as she gave him a big smile. "[color=#8B7765]I'm Toukai Kirio! I carry 18 swords, and I'm twice removed from the Clan leader. I don't know blood release, I don't dress like a weirdo, and barely use anything outside my own specialize style.[/color]"

Kirio snapped as she remembered something else, "[color=#8B7765]I also don't have a silly sounding title, but I kind of want one. Something cool, ya know? Like 'Master of a 1000 blades' or 'Hundred Handed Kirio'! Man, those sound good. Maybe one day I can get one like that. Certainly sounds better than Sahagin Stooler or whatever yours was. Your nickname makes you sound like a creeper or a pervert that wears red. Speaking of, why don't you wear red? Don't you feel like a goof for not wearing red?[/color]"

Kirio seemed to be a nonstop flow of useless prattling. If anything, Ryoga was getting a taste of what it would be like to deal with a 5 year old at that very moment.

			Ryoga was at a loss for words. This woman was talking a mile a minute, and he was having trouble keeping up. He caught the gist of what she was saying though, hearing her say she used her own style and insulting his clothes. [color=#DC143C]"Listen, the outfit of Kiri doesn't suit me. This feels better to me. In any case, looks are unimportant, skill is what matters. If we are to be partners, i'll want to experience your style first hand so i know what i'm working with."[/color]

As Kirio brought up her own title, Ryoga listened close to the names she listed. [color=#DC143C]"According to your names, your mutations must have something to do with holding those swords. An interesting Toukai mutation. It doesn't change the fact that i can't follow the words coming out of your mouth." [/color] Ryoga could respect that she had some degree of skill to use those swords, but he still couldn't deal with her ditzy personality, it was maddening to listen to her ramble on like an academy student.

			"[color=#8B7765]Or maybe I wanna take up being a masseuse and retire, didn't think of that did ya? Oh! That'd be a good nickname, 'Magic Fingers Kirio'![/color]" The woman seemed to be drifting into her own little world then she remembered something and turned back to Ryoga. "[color=#8B7765]By the way, if you wanna get your ass beat, we should probably not do it in here, they get mad when people destroy their offices. So if you wanna get pummeled, we should head to the training grounds, or maybe the roof, either is good with me, the roof is obviously closer, but you know.[/color]"

Kirio seemed to jabber on about distances and elevation differences between the two locations as she lost herself in Kirio-land again. Then for some reason she started talking about birds, which devolved into talking about food, which turned into monologue about how tasty the fried chicken her Uncle made was so amazing. At this point, it was evident that she was the master of all tangents and would carry on forever if she wasn't stopped, gagged, or dragged away.

"[color=#8B7765]Or maybe I wanna take up being a masseuse and retire, didn't think of that did ya? Oh! That'd be a good nickname, 'Magic Fingers Kirio'![/color]" The woman seemed to be drifting into her own little world then she remembered something and turned back to Ryoga. "[color=#8B7765]By the way, if you wanna get your ass beat, we should probably not do it in here, they get mad when people destroy their offices. So if you wanna get pummeled, we should head to the training grounds, or maybe the roof, either is good with me, the roof is obviously closer, but you know.[/color]"

Kirio seemed to jabber on about distances and elevation differences between the two locations as she lost herself in Kirio-land again. Then for some reason she started talking about birds, which devolved into talking about food, which turned into monologue about how tasty the fried chicken her Uncle made was so amazing. At this point, it was evident that she was the master of all tangents and would carry on forever if she wasn't stopped, gagged, or dragged away.

			For a moment Ryoga thought about Kirio as a masseuse, but quickly shook the thought out of his head as this girl wasn't the right kind of person for that. She'd probably get distracted by something and end up shifting someone's spine out of place or something. As she came back down to earth, she mentioned fighting him. Not only that, she mentioned beating his ass. [color=#DC143C]"Ha! As if it would be a contest. No, not today Kirio, but sometime within the near future we'll see what's what. In any case, this office is starting to feel a bit cramped to me, perhaps..."[/color]

Ryoga droned off as it was obvious Kirio was completely lost in space. He thought he saw a single drop of drool forming, and though he couldn't see her eyes he could tell there was absolutely no movement in them. He let out a drawn out sigh and put his hand on his forehead. [color=#DC143C][i]"I don't think this could get any worse. If she zones out during combat, there may be an accident of some kind..."[/i][/color] Ryoga began walking past kirio in her spaced out state, and grabbed her arm on the way out, attempting to get the zombie to follow him on his trek to the rooftop for some fresh air and a bit more spacious an area to converse.

			As Ryoga dragged her to the roof, Kirio was too busy rambling about fried chicken to notice they were about to hit the roof. As they stepped onto the roof Kirio assumed the other man wanted to spare, missing what he said about not fighting today. She took the moment to slip out of her haori before silently leaping up onto the stairwell roof her chakra flowing through her body as she began to prepare to handle her new partner. As she landed, she spun on the ball of her foot like a pirouette before facing the towards Ryoga.

Kirio shifted her weight from one foot to the other and while stretching her arms and shoulders a bit, "[color=#8B7765]Oh I see, you wanna spar after all. If that's the case, then I guess we're gonna see who really is the strongest.[/color]" Kirio said as the skin along her arms started to darken to an umber color. If Ryoga was to see the back thanks to her halterneck shirt having no back, he'd see that her torso and arms were changed in color. Then the oddest thing happened, four additional arms seemed to sprout from her body, coming off her shoulders before she reached down and drew six of her swords.

"[color=#8B7765]Also, could you hang my haori somewhere safe? I would hate to lose it, It's really soft and I just had it cleaned.[/color]"

			Ryoga watched as Kirio lept up onto the stairwell roof, and after mentioning sparring, Her mutation took place. 4 extra arms sprouted from her back, and each of her arms, including the normal ones, grabbed a sword, making 6 total. Ryoga couldn't help but feel impressed by the amount of skill it must take to wield so many weapons at once, but still, today was not the day for something like that, as much as he wanted to. [color=#DC143C]"As much fun as that would be Kirio, we should save this for a better day. I just don't like being cramped up in a tiny office, so i fugured the roof would be a good area to talk and get fresh air. I will compliment your mutation though, i've never seen anything like it from a Toukai. How do you keep track of all of your weapons at once? It must take incredible Tai skill."[/color] Ryoga was not one for compliments, but he had to find something he liked about Kirio, or he wouldn't be able to work with her. luckily, her mutation seemed more than adequate for combat, provided she could actually use all of those weapons simultaneously.

			Kirio seemed lost for a minute as she seemed to be visually putting two and two together about what the man said. "[color=#8B7765]So..... we're not fighting but we came to the roof even then I said it was a great place to fight instead of the office. Okay, you've lost me. OH WAIT! Maybe you're trying to trick me and just wanna gain the upper hand like some kind of crafty sneaky snake person! Or.... you're telling the truth and now we're on the roof for some reason instead of walking out the front door of the building and walking the streets like normal folk. Why? No idea, but maybe you just like rooftops.[/color]"

Kirio seemed to go on a rant before she tossed a blade up and let it flip before catching the handle again. She seemed to trail off from her vocal line of reasoning, mostly because she was now juggling her swords, her tongue sticking out of her twisted up features like she was really concentrating hard. Suddenly she dropped all the blades, or rather let them fall as she dropped her arms. "[color=#8B7765]I forget, why am I up here?[/color]"

Kirio looked at Ryoga with her squinted eyes before snapping her fingers, "[color=#8B7765]That's right, I was talking about something. Massages? No....[/color]" Kirio thought for a minute before looking at Ryoga again and shrugging. "[color=#8B7765]Probably wasn't important anyway.[/color]"

"[color=#8B7765]So..... we're not fighting but we came to the roof even then I said it was a great place to fight instead of the office. Okay, you've lost me. OH WAIT! Maybe you're trying to trick me and just wanna gain the upper hand like some kind of crafty sneaky snake person! Or.... you're telling the truth and now we're on the roof for some reason instead of walking out the front door of the building and walking the streets like normal folk. Why? No idea, but maybe you just like rooftops.[/color]"

Kirio seemed to go on a rant before she tossed a blade up and let it flip before catching the handle again. She seemed to trail off from her vocal line of reasoning, mostly because she was now juggling her swords, her tongue sticking out of her twisted up features like she was really concentrating hard. Suddenly she dropped all the blades, or rather let them fall as she dropped her arms. "[color=#8B7765]I forget, why am I up here?[/color]"

Kirio looked at Ryoga with her squinted eyes before snapping her fingers, "[color=#8B7765]That's right, I was talking about something. Massages? No....[/color]" Kirio thought for a minute before looking at Ryoga again and shrugging. "[color=#8B7765]Probably wasn't important anyway.[/color]"

			It was clearly obvious that Ryoga was boiling with rage, his entire body was trembling as though the force of his anger was too great for him to handle. [color=#DC143C]"I can't take this incessant rambling anymore, if you don't slow down I swear i'll cut your tongue!"[/color] Ryoga was starting to think a fight might be the perfect thing given the situation. But before he began an assault on the squinty eyed devil he was stuck with, he calmed himself, took a deep breath, and relaxed. [color=#DC143C]"Look, as of now i'm not entirely thrilled with the idea of working with you. You're loud, you clearly have attention problems, and you talk faster than i can comprehend. Maybe you can hold your own in a fight, but that doesn't change anything. However, we ARE stuck with each other, so I'll try to make the most of this, but you have to meet me halfway here."[/color]

			"[color=#8B7765]I think my Aunt could just grow me a new one.[/color]" Kirio said to herself quietly as she thought on it. At this point she was trying to remember if it was her Aunt or her cousin that was an iijutsu specialist that could use mass to regrow stuff. Then she looked back at Ryoga as she seemed to have been talking about something. "[color=#8B7765]Halfway for what? The reason we're on this roof? I'm so lost right now.[/color]"

The Jounin was laughing to herself inside as she was enjoying making the other man mad. He seemed to be genuinely upset with her, of course he didn't know the other half of this coin either. Ryoga was missing out on seeing that half by refusing to fight with her, alas that was his decision. Reaching down, Kirio picked up all six of the swords she'd had at the ready, returning them to their sheath since it was clear they wouldn't be sparring today.

			Ryoga was a little upset that Kirio completely blew off his rant, but in the end he didn't really care. chances were it wouldn't stick anyway. Instead he decided to just change the topic. [color=#DC143C]"So level with me here, why don't you explain a bit about your fighting style? How is it you're able to wield so many weapons at once? and just how powerful are your extra arms? Or better yet, what about affinities, and actual ninjutsu, assuming you aren't a one trick pony."[/color] As much as Ryoga loved to use his sword, even he had some skill with ninjutsu to make up for his lack of range. It would benefit him to know his partners affinities and plan accordingly, as well as what kind of ninjutsu his partner had.

			[color=#DC143C]"well, you never know, I know little about the Toukai save for the fact they can mutate themselves, how was i to know whether or not it came at some sort of strength penalty? And... i'd rather not think about that."[/color] Ryoga said as Kirio waved her fingers through the air. The last thing he wanted to think about was what other uses there were for so many arms.

[color=#DC143C]"Ah, so you use Takai Ryuu as well? That's a bit abnormal for a swordsman to use, considering they're melee weapons."[/color] Ryoga was familiar with the infamous High style, it was one of the first Non-sword styles he had ever heard of. The idea always intrigued him, but he never saw much use for taking to the skies when he could just as easily dash and slice his opponent on the ground. Though, if Kirio had a use for it, maybe he would too. [color=#DC143C]"Perhaps you could teach me a bit of it sometime. If you can manage to use swords with Takai Ryuu, i'm sure i can probably manage as well."[/color]

			"[color=#8B7765]Abnormal? Have you seen how many arms I have? That's.... well it's normal for me so maybe it's not abnormal. Then again at least I don't turn into a big monster looking thing like the Clan head, that's abnormal. Of course my cousin grows a second thumb on each hand in his transformations.... Man, makes ya think about what qualifies as normal, doesn't it?[/color]" Kirio thought aloud as she hopped off the stairwell access and landed on the roof.

"[color=#8B7765]But of course by being abnormal to others, we catch them off guard. Nobody expects a swordsman to be so mobile that they can stay airborne. That and it makes it a helluva lot easier to dodge things like acid pools and stuff since you're mostly out of reach again it.[/color]" Kirio pointed out as she grabbed her Haori and slipped it back on, her limbs fading back to their original color as her arms receded back into her body like they had never existed in the first place.

			[color=#DC143C]"I mean, of course it's abnormal. Every clan is abnormal, that's what defines them. Your's just happens to be about growing extra digits and becoming a monster apparently."[/color] Ryoga had never met the leader of the Toukai clan, but based on Kirio's description he didn't want to anytime soon. [color=#DC143C]"And you absolutely right, abnormal is not always a bad thing. You'd be surprised how few ninjas can use Chiton.[/color]

Maybe Kirio wasn't all bad now that Ryoga thought about it. She seemed to know what she was talking about for the most part, she just said it really fast, and more importantly, it was almost impossible to keep her attention for longer than 10 seconds. And to kick it off, the village specifically placed them together. He doubted they would have done that if they thought he might snap, as his track record was quite well known. He was starting to learn how to tolerate her, for the most part.[color=#DC143C]"So, when are you free to train? I train every single day, so any day is good for me."[/color]

			"[color=#8B7765]Uhhhhhhhhh.[/color]" Kirio seemed to lose herself into her mind as if she was trying to dug up some mental wall calendar t check. "[color=#8B7765]I don't really have much.... Whenever I suppose, the only other thing I have to do is train, eat food, massage practice, then who knows what else.[/color]"

Kirio seemed to mentally be going through a list, at least that's what her mouth and hands said as she started pointing to invisible things and her mouth moved silently as if she was talking to herself. Then she just seemed to be doodling on the air before she visibly poked out a smiley face in the air and chuckled to herself.

			[color=#DC143C]"Right, good to know. I didn't think you were serious about the massage thing, but different strokes i suppose."[/color] Ryoga would proceed to walk over to the side of the roof, leaving kirio to talk with herself and draw faces in the air apparently. [color=#DC143C]"I'll be in touch, feel free to ask the man who introduced us for my address if you wish to come see me.

			Go easy on me?  This is my first attempt to actually put this down in written form.  Its the start of an idea, not the final product and there may be individual jutsu to go along with this.  But I need some help in developing this I think.  I want to know the ins and outs of this before I get too close to making it a reality.

Ketsueki Tejina:Ketsueki Tejina is an advanced healing technique and immortality technique that has been developed by Masami Ren.  Through the mastery and study of Iijutsu, Fuuinjutsu, and Chiton she has gained the ability to heal her wounds or reattach her own limbs.  However it does have its weaknesses.  The most tell-tale signs of this ability are the fuuinjutsu seals that cover Ren's entire body, keeping her body together, but also making reattachment possible when a limb is lost, or making 'healing' possible when damage is done.  This healing is done by pulling the damaged tissue back together as well as increasing the production of blood in the body the moment a wound is received.  With this ability Ren can reduce herself to a puddle of blood in order to heal herself when severely damaged, or pull herself back together from such a state back to her own self again.

I've edited to reflect the original idea to give a better idea of where this is starting at.  Also I cannot repeat enough, this is an endgame technique, not something she would get any time soon.

			The weaknesses aren't actually weaknesses.  Weaknesses are things that are IMPROVED against you.  Sankaton/Katon/Acid do their normal thing against you.  An example of a weakness would be a Wood body's weakness to fire.  Instead of normal burning, it'll burn brighter/faster/stronger/etc due to the wood combusting at a much lower temperature and all that.

			I can understand Sankaton doing its normal damage against it, as I mentioned, given its nature.

But Katon and Acid I don't see how it would do the same damage as usual, still do damage, just not the same as normal.

			I really like the idea of this ability, It's similar to Earth Grudge but not done quite the same way. It's an immortality concept i haven't seen before, on the site or otherwise, and the idea of having various states of existence like a puddle and such is something i've always had a soft spot for. I'd love to see you get this on Masami and make blood into something viable, because at current the only people i've seen working with blood are you, me and Sia. I can't really think of anything to improve on that i haven't already said in Cbox, I just wanted to say how i felt about the ability itself.

I really like the idea of this ability, It's similar to Earth Grudge but not done quite the same way. It's an immortality concept i haven't seen before, on the site or otherwise, and the idea of having various states of existence like a puddle and such is something i've always had a soft spot for. I'd love to see you get this on Masami and make blood into something viable, because at current the only people i've seen working with blood are you, me and Sia. I can't really think of anything to improve on that i haven't already said in Cbox, I just wanted to say how i felt about the ability itself.

			Hey all, i have a few Blood techniques that i'm not entirely sure on. This is just a sample of what i want my character to develop from Chiton, and any input i can get would be greatly appreciated. Also, i didn't rank them specifically because i have no idea what rank they would be, some input on that would be great too.

Chiton CustomsShow [color=#DC143C]Heartstopper[/color]

A-rank Ninjutsu

Ryoga performs a string of handseals, then slits his thumb on his sword, draining his blood into the blade while programming it. This jutsu Causes Ryoga's blood to coagulate inside of an enemy's body 1 post after it enters. As the name implies, an organ cut off from blood could fail, causing internal damage or death, while a vein that loses circulation could cause a limb to lose feeling and eventually become paralyzed. The effect is based on where Ryoga makes contact.

[color=#DC143C]Overflow[/color]

B-rank jutsu

Ryoga performs a string of handseals, and focuses on an enemy infected with his blood within 30 meters. This jutsu requres concentration and constant chakra flow to keep active, but it causes the opponents blood pressure to skyrocket, pushing the vascular system to the bursting point, causing intense crippling pain throughout their body.

[color=#DC143C]Living Bomb[/color]

B-rank Ninjutsu

Ryoga performs a string of handseals, then slits his thumb on his sword, draining his blood into the blade while programming it. This jutsu causes Ryoga's blood to become volatile. 1 post after the target is infected, an explosion with the force of 5 exploding tags occurs within the enemies body wherever Ryoga's blood was located.
Vascular GlimpseShow

[color=#DC143C]Vascular Glimpse[/color]

This ability is the result of extensive chiton sensing combined with Ryoga's infection style. In order to fully utilize his method of combat, Ryoga developed this Doujutsu. This doujutsu allows Ryoga to see the underlying vascular system of his target. It also allows him to tell the difference between someone else's blood and his own, which appears as blue compared to the red color of his target's blood. This doujutsu is constantly active, turning the iris of Ryoga's eyes red, and taking a permanent -1 stamina devoted solely to keeping it active.

Prerequisites:

25 chiton techniques

Chiton empathy sensing

15 chiton empathy techniques

-1 stamina dedicated to the Doujutsu

			Alright, I'm going to say I'm being very blunt for this review.

Frankly these techniques are (minus the last one, Cold Blood, is C-Rank) are all A-Ranks at least considering what your doing and affecting things inside your target's body.

At the very least, for these techniques to work your control will need to be higher than the target's control and your going to have to be much closer than 30 meters. Try 5 tops. Another aspect is your control would have to overcome the target's strength since flowing blood around would literally be fighting the target's muscles since that controls blood flow in the body.

Finally Razor Veins simply won't work because one the human body can't produce iron (its its own atomic element). Now if you cause the person to produce large amounts of blood to increase their blood pressure, that would work mostly and the breach in conservation of mass can be ignored.

The main fact that you will need to understand is most of these techniques are instant wins with no means of defending against. So if you can try and consider how to at least give them some form of weakness.

			please dark, be blunt, because no one else is helping me understand Chiton.

yeah, i figured they would be high ranked, and i'm totally fine with that. also the high control is fine, since control is a prerequisite for most high ranked blood jutsu. The range thing is kinda meh, because i'm going to have to get in close to infect them in the first place. Also i'm not quite sure someone could control their own muscles to stop their bloodflow, i think a battle of control is more plausible.

and yeah, i think your idea of razor veins works way better than mine actually, i can't believe i didn't think of that XD. also i didn't know the human body didn't produce natural iron, so shit on me it seems.

They are instant wins, you're absolutely right, but it requires me to get close enough to get at least one good strike in. That's the entire premise of my character: Rush down with speed, get one decent strike in, infect with blood, cause any effects i desire through my blood inside their body. I'll have to come up with things i can do at lower ranks though, more like cold blood, but i don't want to do a whole lot of debuffs.

Also, as a side note, am i crazy, or does chiton's persistence effect mean that i can have jutsu lasting for longer than average posts? i see jutsu on there lasting for 10-15 posts, and those are archives.

			sorry to DP, but i added ranks, removed a few techniques, and changed the initial concept of the techniques due to a conversation in Cbox. now the techs are about programming my blood to perform certain tasks, not controlling it within someone after infection. I also added a custom ability that ties in with Ryoga's combat style.

["This is my happy face."]

[b]General Information[/b]
[b]Age:[/b] 13

[b]Gender:[/b] Female

[b]Height:[/b] 5'4 feet

[b]Weight:[/b] 110 lbs.

[b]Hair:[/b] Kiyori's short black hair has an off center part, making her hair cover the right side of her face.

[b]Eyes:[/b] Kiroyi's eyes are a solid black when her doujutsu isn't active, the same as all Henrin

[b]Physical Features:[/b] Kiroyi has a very lean frame, with long thin legs and a small waist with a decent backside, as well as a lack of bust at almost B cups. Her skin is a pale white and is completely unblemished, with not a scar on her body. She usually has a very stoic look on her face, as though nothing phases her.

[b]Clothing/Accessories:[/b] During missions or when training, Kiyori wears an outfit tailored to her enviroment. The outfits are always the same design; a half face mask covering her nose to neck, a short sleeved black shirt with long sleeve mesh armor underneath, fingerless gloves, Tight mid thigh shorts with mesh armor from mid thigh to ankle, a belt with two shuriken holsters on the front, a ninja pouch attached to the right hip and right thigh, and Ninja sandles. Her current outfit colors are tan desert camo and pure black night camo. When not on misions, Kiyori's outfits are usually short sleeved tops and short shorts with sandles to mitigate the desert heat.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] Worn on her forehead, though only half is usually visible due to Kiyori's hair.

[b]Personality:[/b] Kiyori's constant emotionless expression leads most people to believe she's depressed or bored, but she feels all the normal things a 13 year old girl feels. She comes off as cold almost all of the time, having a bored, monotone voice in almost everything she says. In truth, Kiroyi is actually really goofy, and has a penchant for sarcasm in the face of stupidity.  Anyone who can get around her standoffish expression can find a loyal friend and ally.

She takes incredible pride in her work, following her missions to the letter whenever possible. She also takes her training very seriously, pouring hours of time into training her mind and body to perfect her abilities.

10 kunai in pouch on right hip

a canteen of water in pouch on right hip

[b]Combat Style:[/b]

 Kiyori's main tactics are ambush techniques, traps, and precise combat. She aims to remain undetected for as long as possible, and silently eliminate enemies to avoid raising alarms. if caught in open conflict, she relies on her Henrin taijutsu to deal with enemies, striking precise areas of the body using her Doujutsu.

Tripod

Prerequisite: Setting Up the Equipment, Snapshot

This is the main fighting style utilized by the Henrin clan. Unlike other fighting styles that revolve around balance with a firm base, clan members instead focus on offensive attacks and strikes. This does leave them open to more lower attacks, but, due to their doujutsu, they are able to see some of those moves and prepare for them ahead of time. The basic stance is with one leg firmly on the ground, with the body shifted to the direction of their leg, with both hands in a curved position.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b]

Bloodline Limit:

- Shutter Eye -

This is the doujutsu of the Henrin clan, to the point that they're regarded all over the lands for their abilities, being a very well revered doujutsu. While active, the Shutter Eye memorizes every little thing that it sees, from sceneries, creatures, to certain movements very rapidly. Not only does the user have the ability to remember it, but they also possess the ability to recall any of it at a moment's notice. Any movement that is made, they can remember it and recall it, making them near experts at taijutsu. Most abilities do need jutsu to follow it, however.

Clan members are able to keep their doujutsu active for a number of posts equal to their stamina stat. Then, once the eye turns off, it must stay off for that same amount of time as a cooldown period. While their eye is 'off' they aren't able to recall any of the stored memories.

[b]Jutsu:[/b]
Tripod StyleShow
~Tripod – Setting Up the Equipment

D-Ranked Taijutsu

This is the basic stance of Henrin clan members. To start, the clan member raises their left or right leg (depending on their dominant hand), as if they were doing a side kick. This stance gives them extra reach with their leg, in a constant base stance for a kick, while both of their hands are in a striking position. This stance has some drawbacks, however. Due to only one leg constantly being on the ground, they are more susceptible to ground based attacks. However, due to constant training on that one leg being their pillar of support, it is a lot harder for someone to actually trip them or cause the leg to fall. It’s still possible, of course, but it would take more compared to a normal person.

 ~Tripod – Flash!

D-Ranked Taijutsu

This is more of a base technique, rather than a specific one, but, while using kicks and punches, the user aims for waiting for exactly the right moment, then, in a flash of movement, strikes with all of their power. To those with an average of taijutsu and wit stat less than the user’s speed, it can appear as if no movement was actually made.

~Tripod – Snapshot

C-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: Shutter Eye active

Since the clan member has the ability to remember exactly where they hit, they are able to utilize their Taijutsu skills to their maximum ability. Rather than putting their full power into each hit, they purposefully tone down their own hits, making their moves also just ‘barely’ miss, while in fact they are hitting with an incredible accuracy along with using the maximum power possible for the style. In doing so, each actual hit barely feels like anything at all, until the ‘final’ hit. This will make it seem like a whole lot more power was in the actual hit, due to the previous damage, while also causing a massive pain throughout the target’s body.
Henrin TaijutsuShow
~Shutter Eye - Storage

D-Ranked Taijutsu

This is the most basic jutsu and a requirement of all clan members and expected of them to learn by the time that they are 4 years old. This allows the clan member, while the Shutter Eye is active, to store data inside of it. This allows them to recall the data at a later date.

~Shutter Eye - Recall - Taijutsu - E

D-Ranked Taijutsu

By seeing and recording someone that has used a taijutsu skill, the clan member is able to see and play back the taijutsu. By studying that jutsu, the clan member is able to learn from that taijutsu and learn how to mimic it. This lets them take 200 words off of an E ranked taijutsu that they are training, that they have recorded, to a minimum 400.

~Shutter Eye - Recall - Taijutsu - D

C-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: Shutter Eye - Recall - Taijutsu - E

By seeing and recording someone that has used a taijutsu skill, the clan member is able to see and play back the taijutsu. By studying that jutsu, the clan member is able to learn from that taijutsu and learn how to mimic it. This lets them take 200 words off of a D ranked taijutsu that they are training, that they have recorded, to a minimum 400.
TaijutsuShow

[b]*Ambidexterity[/b]

D - Ranked Taijutsu

Requires: 5 Taijutsu

After extensive practice and training the character has gained equal strength and skill between their two hands. This allows them to perform any action with either hand at exactly the same skill level and strength.

[b]*Skillful Wield[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: 3 wit

With a solid foundation of knowledge on their choice of weaponry, those with the Skillful Wield technique are able to utilize their weapon more fully. By knowing the weapon's weakest points, the user is able to avoid presenting these areas to damage during combat, thus making their weapon less likely to break by means of recklessness.
NinpouShow

[b]*Chakra Kai[/b]

E-Ranked Ninjutsu

A jutsu used with the purpose of activating seals and a range of devices and weapons, this technique begins with a single handseal. Once this has been performed, the user will focus a dollop of his/her chakra into what s/he is looking to activate in order to complete the task. Seals activated with this technique must be within 20 yards of the user's position.

[b]*Grouping Chakra Kai[/b]

D-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Chakra Kai

By utilizing the fundamentals of Chakra Kai, this jutsu allows the user to activate multiple seals at a single time rather than needing to cast multiple uses of Chakra Kai. This can only be used on the same seal, meaning the user can't activate three different seals, but s/he can activate up to three of a single seal with this jutsu. This technique's range depends on the type of Chakra Kai used to activate it.

[b]History[/b]

Kiroyi was born to a normal branch of Henrin, with 5 sisters and 6 brothers, all born within a year of each other, with her being the last in line. Growing up with so many other siblings, It was easy to get pushed to the back, like the runt of the litter. This was the case with Kiyori, as she very rarely got a chance to express herself. As such, she developed sort of a monotone voice that showed no emotion, regardless of how she actually felt. Other than that, her upbringing was normal for that of the Henrin; Being trained in her doujutsu, as well as the basics of the Tripod style, in preparation for the acadamy.

During her academy years, Kiyori had little to do with her classmates, though not by choice. She wasn't quite shunned, but her tone did cause a good portion of students to avoid her, calling her "weird" and "depressed". This bothered her alot, as she didn't understand what the problem really was, she seemed normal to herself, even though it had been pointed out to her before. Drama aside though, she was a very skilled student, proving to be one of the smartest and physically skilled students in the academy, as most Henrin were. She discovered her affinity for Doton during the academy, but hasn't really made anything of it yet, as her ninjutsu was a bit lacking. despite this, she graduated the academy at the age of 13.

As Kiyori is fresh out of the academy, she hasn't had the opportunity to make any sort of name for herself. She aims to improve on her Doujutsu, and learn many of Suna's specialties, such as Puppetry and Sand. She longs to find teammates that she can call friends, and a sensei to teach her what it is to be a ninja.

 Kiyori's main tactics are ambush techniques, traps, and precise combat. She aims to remain undetected for as long as possible, and silently eliminate enemies to avoid raising alarms. if caught in open conflict, she relies on her Henrin taijutsu to deal with enemies, striking precise areas of the body using her Doujutsu.

Tripod

Prerequisite: Setting Up the Equipment, Snapshot

This is the main fighting style utilized by the Henrin clan. Unlike other fighting styles that revolve around balance with a firm base, clan members instead focus on offensive attacks and strikes. This does leave them open to more lower attacks, but, due to their doujutsu, they are able to see some of those moves and prepare for them ahead of time. The basic stance is with one leg firmly on the ground, with the body shifted to the direction of their leg, with both hands in a curved position.

- Shutter Eye -

This is the doujutsu of the Henrin clan, to the point that they're regarded all over the lands for their abilities, being a very well revered doujutsu. While active, the Shutter Eye memorizes every little thing that it sees, from sceneries, creatures, to certain movements very rapidly. Not only does the user have the ability to remember it, but they also possess the ability to recall any of it at a moment's notice. Any movement that is made, they can remember it and recall it, making them near experts at taijutsu. Most abilities do need jutsu to follow it, however.

Clan members are able to keep their doujutsu active for a number of posts equal to their stamina stat. Then, once the eye turns off, it must stay off for that same amount of time as a cooldown period. While their eye is 'off' they aren't able to recall any of the stored memories.

[b]Jutsu:[/b]
Tripod StyleShow
~Tripod – Setting Up the Equipment

D-Ranked Taijutsu

This is the basic stance of Henrin clan members. To start, the clan member raises their left or right leg (depending on their dominant hand), as if they were doing a side kick. This stance gives them extra reach with their leg, in a constant base stance for a kick, while both of their hands are in a striking position. This stance has some drawbacks, however. Due to only one leg constantly being on the ground, they are more susceptible to ground based attacks. However, due to constant training on that one leg being their pillar of support, it is a lot harder for someone to actually trip them or cause the leg to fall. It’s still possible, of course, but it would take more compared to a normal person.

 ~Tripod – Flash!

D-Ranked Taijutsu

This is more of a base technique, rather than a specific one, but, while using kicks and punches, the user aims for waiting for exactly the right moment, then, in a flash of movement, strikes with all of their power. To those with an average of taijutsu and wit stat less than the user’s speed, it can appear as if no movement was actually made.

~Tripod – Snapshot

C-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: Shutter Eye active

Since the clan member has the ability to remember exactly where they hit, they are able to utilize their Taijutsu skills to their maximum ability. Rather than putting their full power into each hit, they purposefully tone down their own hits, making their moves also just ‘barely’ miss, while in fact they are hitting with an incredible accuracy along with using the maximum power possible for the style. In doing so, each actual hit barely feels like anything at all, until the ‘final’ hit. This will make it seem like a whole lot more power was in the actual hit, due to the previous damage, while also causing a massive pain throughout the target’s body.
Henrin TaijutsuShow
~Shutter Eye - Storage

D-Ranked Taijutsu

This is the most basic jutsu and a requirement of all clan members and expected of them to learn by the time that they are 4 years old. This allows the clan member, while the Shutter Eye is active, to store data inside of it. This allows them to recall the data at a later date.

~Shutter Eye - Recall - Taijutsu - E

D-Ranked Taijutsu

By seeing and recording someone that has used a taijutsu skill, the clan member is able to see and play back the taijutsu. By studying that jutsu, the clan member is able to learn from that taijutsu and learn how to mimic it. This lets them take 200 words off of an E ranked taijutsu that they are training, that they have recorded, to a minimum 400.

TaijutsuShow

[b]*Ambidexterity[/b]

D - Ranked Taijutsu

Requires: 5 Taijutsu

After extensive practice and training the character has gained equal strength and skill between their two hands. This allows them to perform any action with either hand at exactly the same skill level and strength.

[b]*Skillful Wield[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: 3 wit

With a solid foundation of knowledge on their choice of weaponry, those with the Skillful Wield technique are able to utilize their weapon more fully. By knowing the weapon's weakest points, the user is able to avoid presenting these areas to damage during combat, thus making their weapon less likely to break by means of recklessness.
NinpouShow

[b]*Chakra Kai[/b]

E-Ranked Ninjutsu

A jutsu used with the purpose of activating seals and a range of devices and weapons, this technique begins with a single handseal. Once this has been performed, the user will focus a dollop of his/her chakra into what s/he is looking to activate in order to complete the task. Seals activated with this technique must be within 20 yards of the user's position.

[b]*Grouping Chakra Kai[/b]

D-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Chakra Kai

By utilizing the fundamentals of Chakra Kai, this jutsu allows the user to activate multiple seals at a single time rather than needing to cast multiple uses of Chakra Kai. This can only be used on the same seal, meaning the user can't activate three different seals, but s/he can activate up to three of a single seal with this jutsu. This technique's range depends on the type of Chakra Kai used to activate it.

[b]History[/b]

Kiroyi was born to a normal branch of Henrin, with 5 sisters and 6 brothers, all born within a year of each other, with her being the last in line. Growing up with so many other siblings, It was easy to get pushed to the back, like the runt of the litter. This was the case with Kiyori, as she very rarely got a chance to express herself. As such, she developed sort of a monotone voice that showed no emotion, regardless of how she actually felt. Other than that, her upbringing was normal for that of the Henrin; Being trained in her doujutsu, as well as the basics of the Tripod style, in preparation for the acadamy.

During her academy years, Kiyori had little to do with her classmates, though not by choice. She wasn't quite shunned, but her tone did cause a good portion of students to avoid her, calling her "weird" and "depressed". This bothered her alot, as she didn't understand what the problem really was, she seemed normal to herself, even though it had been pointed out to her before. Drama aside though, she was a very skilled student, proving to be one of the smartest and physically skilled students in the academy, as most Henrin were. She discovered her affinity for Doton during the academy, but hasn't really made anything of it yet, as her ninjutsu was a bit lacking. despite this, she graduated the academy at the age of 13.

As Kiyori is fresh out of the academy, she hasn't had the opportunity to make any sort of name for herself. She aims to improve on her Doujutsu, and learn many of Suna's specialties, such as Puppetry and Sand. She longs to find teammates that she can call friends, and a sensei to teach her what it is to be a ninja.

["This is my happy face."]

[b]General Information[/b]
[b]Age:[/b] 13

[b]Gender:[/b] Female

[b]Height:[/b] 5'4 feet

[b]Weight:[/b] 110 lbs.

[b]Hair:[/b] Kiyori's short black hair has an off center part, making her hair cover the right side of her face.

[b]Eyes:[/b] Kiroyi's eyes are a solid black when her doujutsu isn't active, the same as all Henrin

[b]Physical Features:[/b] Kiroyi has a very lean frame, with long thin legs and a small waist with a decent backside, as well as a lack of bust at almost B cups. Her skin is a pale white and is completely unblemished, with not a scar on her body. She usually has a very stoic look on her face, as though nothing phases her.

[b]Clothing/Accessories:[/b] During missions or when training, Kiyori wears an outfit tailored to her enviroment. The outfits are always the same design; a half face mask covering her nose to neck, a short sleeved black shirt with long sleeve mesh armor underneath, fingerless gloves, Tight mid thigh shorts with mesh armor from mid thigh to ankle, a belt with two shuriken holsters on the front, a ninja pouch attached to the right hip and right thigh, and Ninja sandles. Her current outfit colors are tan desert camo and pure black night camo. When not on misions, Kiyori's outfits are usually short sleeved tops and short shorts with sandles to mitigate the desert heat.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] Worn on her forehead, though only half is usually visible due to Kiyori's hair.

[b]Personality:[/b] Kiyori's constant emotionless expression leads most people to believe she's depressed or bored, but she feels all the normal things a 13 year old girl feels. She comes off as cold almost all of the time, having a bored, monotone voice in almost everything she says. In truth, Kiroyi is actually really goofy, and has a penchant for sarcasm in the face of stupidity.  Anyone who can get around her standoffish expression can find a loyal friend and ally.

She takes incredible pride in her work, following her missions to the letter whenever possible. She also takes her training very seriously, pouring hours of time into training her mind and body to perfect her abilities.

			Sanjuku woke up at 6AM, same as always, and started his daily routine as normal. After eating breakfast, showering, putting on his black sleeveless shirt and green baggy pants, and spiking his hair to the back-right side of his head like normal, he went out the door, and started his workout. Jogging through Suna, the village was starting to wake up, being that the time was around 8 at this point. After jogging to his usual training area, an open area with a bench to sit on and a few training dummies for practicing combat, about 3 miles from his house, he began his strength training, performing push-ups, sit-ups, and a little shadowboxing. the usual stuff. He always kept to his routine as best as possible, good routine sets up for greatness he always told himself.

After finishing his workout, it was time to do his favorite part of his routine: Weapon training. After tying his Kote to his arms, he began to practice his punches, following through and arcing to the opposite side of his body while shifting his weight from one leg to the other in a fluid motion, extending his elbows forward to catch with the blades. He had already worked up quite a sweat, and decided to take a break for a few minutes, wiping off his body with his towel and resting on a nearby bench.

			Shigekuni had spent the past few weeks training himself stupid it seemed. When he wasn't pushing his muscles to their limits he was putting his brains threshold for information intake. He had been pouring over books just as much as he had been pounding a punching bag. However he had discovered his bodies threshold for such endeavors and he decided that it was just a little too much at this point to keep going. A break of some kind was necessary, and he wasn't thinking of a small one hour break, oh no. He needed a few days to let his body sooth itself before he took to physical or mental training again.

If anything, he could plan out his next move for how he was gonna find more information. This 'Sage' style he had been hunting information down for was proving to be rather illusive. He was definitely going to need to check the Scribes library and see if they had any information that would shed some light on this style. All he could tell from the information he'd been looking up was that it was old, possibly on the verge of being forgotten to most everyone save the small percentage that still had records of these things or first hand encounters with practitioners.

Shigekuni had been walking as he brainstormed, passing through various parts of the village before he wound up at the training ground. "[color=#95BD4F]Hmmm, must have walked here on instinct. Then again I was heavy in thought, maybe I'm just so used to coming here.[/color]" Shigekuni said to himself as he looked around the training ground and saw only one person here. They were sitting on a bench and looked to be wearing some bizarre gauntlets with blades attached to them.

 "[color=#95BD4F]Why would you have such limited use weapons on your gauntlets? Even if you train yourself to be useful with them, you still leave yourself wide open I'm betting.[/color]" The Genin stated openly to the other youth.

			Sanjuku didn't even notice the boy approach him until he started speaking. And after hearing what he had to say, he wasn't too pleased with him being there either. [color=#ee4a2d]"Heh... these weapons were given to my by my father because i wanted something that stands out. Besides, you can't honestly tell me these bad-boys dont look amazing!"[/color] He said as he flourished the blades by taking a battle ready stance. [color=#ee4a2d]"and to answer your question, anything can be used effectively with enough training. its all about style, and i've got plenty of that."[/color] He said taking a seat on the bench again.

He didn't know who this kid was, but from the looks of his outfit he didn't know anything about style. [color=#ee4a2d]"i suppose i could use a bit more ofbreak from the training for a few minutes, why don't you stick around and talk for a bit huh?"[/color] He said, motioning for the kid to take a seat. [color=#ee4a2d]"Names Ouji Sanjuku. what brings you around here anyways? you don't look like you're training or anything."[/color]

			The boy before him must have favored fashion over function, he seemed obsessed with looks more than how functional something was. As he struck a battle stance, Shigekuni could already point out at least three flaws in his posture, if anything he had the eagerness a typical genin possessed but he didn't seem to be that experienced with real combat. Obviously he was a nitwit.

"[color=#95BD4F]I'll stand, I've been sitting for quite a while lately.[/color]" Shigekuni replied to the offer to sit, yet he didn't make any move to leave yet. He was here, he may as well converse with this Ouji Sanjuku person. "[color=#95BD4F]If I was training, I'd be wearing the same clothing I do now. If anything I might remove my jacket in order to keep from over heating. But training wasn't my goal today, I'm taking a hiatus from all physical and mental training.[/color]" He didn't bother mentioning the Sage Style he was researching, he would have preferred to kept that close to the vest for now.

"[color=#95BD4F]Also you realize your stance is sloppy, right?[/color]" Shigekuni added casually like it was so simple to bring up that the way one has been practicing their combat style for years is still flawed.

			[color=#ee4a2d]"Alright, suit yourself then stiffy."[/color] Sanjuku wasn't sure how he felt about this Genin. He obviously had a sense of skill, but he also seemed to be too sure of himself. Then again, who was he to talk? He was totally prideful and he knew it, but he hadn't talked to someone like this before, something about him seemed... weird. like he wasn't afraid of what Sanjuku might say or do in response to his smartass's remarks.

Sanjuku was also completely taken aback by this Genin's forwardness. To openly insult the way he fought was infuriating, but he kept his cool for the time being. He sounded incredibly defensive when he spoke.[color=#ee4a2d]" It's a work in progress. And pray tell, how would YOU know my fighting style is sloppy?"[/color] Sanjuku wasn't thrilled with this kids attitude, but he sensed a certainty in him that he envied. He stood from the bench, brandished his weapons once more, and went at a nearby training dummy, punching and slashing right to left, beating the dummy to a pulp. [color=#ee4a2d]"Why don't you tell me what i did wrong then, if your so smart."[/color] Sanjuku retorted.

			Shigekuni motioned toward the practice ground "[color=#95BD4F]Take a stance and strike at the target. When you hit it, hold that position and I'll point out where you are lacking.[/color]" Shigekuni was practically an expert on pointing out sloppy strikes and stances thanks to his parents. They often helped him learn about his the hard way. While he was grateful for it, back then it left him a bit sore when they smacked a switch against his ribs to point out the opening in his attacks.

"[color=#95BD4F]Why bladed gauntlets? Why not Tekagi-Shuko or Tonfa? They're just as under utilized but they provide greater diversity then those things.[/color]" Shigekuni asked as he examined the other genin's weapons. To him, they just seemed so flawed and unreliable it seemed. There were a plethora of other weapons that could be used to fight in far more effective ways. When it came down to it, Shigekuni just felt that the use of those gauntlets just irked him a little.

			[color=#ee4a2d]"Hmph, suit yourself, i'll humor you I guess."[/color] He wasn't particularly thrilled with this boy pointing out his flaws, but deep down he knew he wasn't exactly an expert fighter. He had a lot left to learn, and an entire fighting style to develop, so while he was too proud to say it, he could use the help. He attacked the dummy again, punching with his right arm, then continuing the motion to slash with the blade, then while switching momentum punched with the left arm going across and slicing with the blade as he switched back over to his starting stance. He repeated this movement a few times, slowly gliding through it, so as to let the boy examine his stance.

			Shigekuni watched the other boy go through the motions a few times slowly and he could already see what was wrong. His punches weren't getting enough momentum for one. Also his slashes were being incorporated into the punches which was slowing things down. They were also leaving him vulnerable if he just stood there to deliver both a punch and slash.

"[color=#95BD4F]You're not putting yourself into your punches. You need to use you abs, put your body behind the swing. Also I'd try keeping the punches and slashes separate, they're slowing you down when you combine them. They also leave you open a little too. But that's all I can really see right now.[/color]" Shigekuni pointed out as he walked over to a dummy himself and balled up his fist. Pulling his arm back, he thrust his arm forward, twisting his upper body as he threw himself into a simple yet powerful punch that made a solid BAM! as it hit the dummy. It wasn't the strongest punch the other boy might have seen, but the form was very good for a Genin. Shaking his hand a bit to get rid of the ouchies, Shigekuni looked back to the other boy. "[color=#95BD4F]Kind of like what I just did, but then again I'm sure we'll get better at this crap when we've had more training.[/color]"

			Sanjuku was about to retort with some snappy remark to make himself seem above this boy, but as he thought about the points he was making, perhaps it was better to focus on punching OR slashing, not both. It would do less damage, but it took less to do and would leave him far less open during strikes. [color=#ee4a2d]"Well, i guess the green behind my ears must be showing huh? Yeah, truth be told, perhaps Tekagi-Shufo would be more practical, but these gauntlets were my graduation gift from my father. He understood what i wanted in a weapon, and i feel i would be letting him down if i just ditched them without even trying to make them work. Besides, some of the best ninja are specifically known by their bizarre weaponry, so why not bladed gauntlets?"[/color] With that, Sanjuku took a seat once more on the bench, but continued talking to this genin whose name he had not even learned yet.

[color=#ee4a2d]"However, what you said is completely correct, I should focus on one or the other when it comes to my punches. Maybe you could help me fix my stance sometime?"[/color] Under normal circumstances, he would never ask for help, but he was starting to see that this boy knew what he was talking about, and to shirk off his help would be a step in the wrong direction for his development. [color=#ee4a2d]"And by the way, I never caught your name Stiffy."[/color] It seemed that "Stiffy" was Sanjuku's nickname for the nameless Genin boy.

			Are you wanting to remove the ability itself and a jutsu or just the ability? 'Cause you're using Empathy which'll require the ability.

			[color=#9300C4][b]"Tch,"[/b][/color] Arsenal sucked his teeth. [color=#9300C4][b]"The sun isn't even up yet. How insane. Who knew waking up this early was even possible?"[/b][/color]

It was almost five AM and a youth was walking in Kumo. The youthful genin, Arsenal, rose much early. He usually woke at eleven or twelve, but not today, he had training his sensei, Tokaido, assigned. Tokaido-sensei said to come prepared so he did. He wore his usual grabs, a silver jumpsuit with a shorten sleeve and pant leg, a shuriken design on the chest, and traditional gray shinobi sandals. He was armed with twenty shuriken in a holster strapped to his leg and ten kunai, two smoke pellets, and eight explosion notes in a round rear pouch.

The kid had not the slightest inkling of what his sensei had planned, but he knew Modoka was invited. He looked forward to learning some type of medical jutsu from him.

Arsenal leaped down the side of a mountain, rock to rock until reaching an island-like base. At the bottom of the mountain was mainly sea. Where the genin landed was a patch of land with earth and grass by the mountain, then sand, then the sea. The patch was large enough to be compared to the average training ground. The area was where he met his cell. It was relaxing like a tropical vacation there, too bad it was cold, fairly dark, and on top of that, had to train.

[color=#9300C4][b]"Here!"[/b][/color] Shouted Arsenal from the last leap down. [color=#9300C4][b]"Anyone miss the witty zinger?"[/b][/color]

			Tokaido awaited his genin underling at the training ground, hidden by a sort of makeshift ghili suit in the grass simply watching and waiting for him to arrive. He wore his usual black vest and sleeveless shirt, but instead wore a dark green camo version of his usual pants, to aid him in camouflaging himself in the grass. He had been awake since 3AM, as he was used to doing this kind of thing whenever he went hunting. He held a single kunai in his right hand as well, in case he wanted to take a shot at something, or someone.

He didn't expect Dememaru to land near his hiding spot, though he believed his camouflage to be adequate to hide him, as the boy hadn't noticed him laying on the ground no more than 10 feet away. Tokaido wouldn't flex a muscle, as a single movement could alert Dememaru if his eyes were good enough. If Dememaru didn't notice Tokaido, he would simply lay there until Madoka arrived, at which point he would make his presence known.

Sunagakure no Sato is a village of mighty warriors and even the mightier of clans. Ninja that walk in and out of the village hold many rights and duties that they must perform in order to become better and better; missions being one of those duties.

The day was dry and hot. The sun was shining directly over the village and it wasn't even past noon yet. The villagers were all wandering around the streets taking in their daily lives, working, and doing menial things that were apart of their routines. The merchants were selling their supplies, the florists selling their flowers, and the restaurants selling their food to the public. It was just a busy day like all other.

One man in particular, a chubby one, stood outside his mail office waiting for the genin that had hired to deliver some paper work for him, as well as fix a few other problems if he so wished. He swept in a red and blue checkered shirt and white khakis. He wore brown sandals on his feet and had a red visor on his head and round glasses over his eyes. His hair was a dark brown and he had a full grown beard that looked wild and untamed. If that seemed okay, his raunchy smell would make any who walk near him want to cover their noses and get away as quickly as possible.

Was it worth the try.. who knew, but a mission is a mission.

Sunagakure no Sato is a village of mighty warriors and even the mightier of clans. Ninja that walk in and out of the village hold many rights and duties that they must perform in order to become better and better; missions being one of those duties.

The day was dry and hot. The sun was shining directly over the village and it wasn't even past noon yet. The villagers were all wandering around the streets taking in their daily lives, working, and doing menial things that were apart of their routines. The merchants were selling their supplies, the florists selling their flowers, and the restaurants selling their food to the public. It was just a busy day like all other.

One man in particular, a chubby one, stood outside his mail office waiting for the genin that had hired to deliver some paper work for him, as well as fix a few other problems if he so wished. He swept in a red and blue checkered shirt and white khakis. He wore brown sandals on his feet and had a red visor on his head and round glasses over his eyes. His hair was a dark brown and he had a full grown beard that looked wild and untamed. If that seemed okay, his raunchy smell would make any who walk near him want to cover their noses and get away as quickly as possible.

Was it worth the try.. who knew, but a mission is a mission.

			Sanjuku raced to the mail office he was called to. He wasn't too thrilled about being someone's lackey, but every Genin has to start somewhere. He turned the corner and before he knew it, he was in front of the mail office, looking at a man with absolutely terribly fashion sense. His shirt was repulsive, and as he approached he caught hint of a foul odor that he hoped wasn't his client. [color=#ee4a2d]"So, it seems your the one who hired me. My name is Sanjuku Ouji. It is my mission to help you today."[/color] His voice held a bit of reluctance, but it wasn't as though he could turn tail now. He waited patiently for the man to speak.

			The man looked down as if trying to identify the boy that he was going to give all of his precious cargo to. He kept staring up and down the boys body to check and see if this kid was really going to be the one to do all of the work but nevertheless he could not be mad because the kazekage himself was the one to elect the genin to do the mission anyway.

Even before saying a word the man turned his back to the boy and started to walk inside the post office. [b]"Coming along now boy?"[/b] his raspy voice would speak as his swinging front door moved back and forth after his foot steps would move on through.

Everything would even be fine and dandy for the genin until he walked into the office to see stacks and stacks of packages towering all four walls of the main room. It was surely going to be a busy day as the man was caught walking toward behind a counter with a clipboard, paper and a pen. [b]"We start here with the list and we move all these packages a day!"[/b]

			As the man stared him down, Sanjuku felt his eyes look him over from top to bottom, like an examination. He was about to tell him off, but as he started the man simply turned around and walked inside, uttering for him to follow. Sanjuku followed the man inside the post office, pushing the swinging front door out of his way as he walked into the building with his employer.

As he walked in, he was immediately overcome with hate for this man. There were more packages in this room then he could count, all four walls covered almost from top to bottom in packages. [color=#ee4a2d]"Woah, so ALL of these need to be delivered today? How am i supposed to do that by myself?"[/color] Sanjuku was dreading this day even more, as the sea of packages overwhelmed him. He silently wished the Kazekage had chosen something different for him, but all that could be done about it now was to grin and bear it.

			Hearing the complaints from the boy made the old man feel a bit over the top and heated as he looked down at him, eyes beading back and forth. [b]"Well now if you don't want to be here for the job that you were hired for than go home so I can report back to your superiors. If you continue to act like a little brat I will have you off of the ninja in a heart beat and forced to work labor with me forever!"[/b] he began to rant as he rambled on and on for a good five minutes.

It was strange hearing the man scream like that when he was only soft voiced and kind only moments before. Talk about a terrible person to be paired up with as he paced over to a corner before grabbing a big box and throwing it to the genin. [b]"Take this to the address on top and report back in no less than five minutes!"[/b] he yelled angrily, as the box read an address that was only three blocks over.

When the boy would walk outside, he would see traffic of people running in and around the streets.

			As the man started onto his rant about Sanjuku's work ethic and how he could get him working with the man forever, Sanjuku merely stood silently and let the man let off his steam. Perhaps he was a bit quick to call the man out, but regardless, his job was apparent, and for the time being he would comply. In the midst of the man rant, he threw a box to Sanjuku, which he reactively caught, knocking him out of the trance he was in to tune the man's anger out. [color=#ee4a2d]"Yes sir, i'll be back shortly."[/color] Sanjuku said before he rushed out the door into the crowded street.

As he walked into the street, he immediately realized that the streets were not an option, the people around made it simply too hard to get around quickly. He decided to quickly run up the side of the building and start jumping along the rooftops to quickly get to the address marked on the top of the package.

As the man started onto his rant about Sanjuku's work ethic and how he could get him working with the man forever, Sanjuku merely stood silently and let the man let off his steam. Perhaps he was a bit quick to call the man out, but regardless, his job was apparent, and for the time being he would comply. In the midst of the man rant, he threw a box to Sanjuku, which he reactively caught, knocking him out of the trance he was in to tune the man's anger out. [color=#ee4a2d]"Yes sir, i'll be back shortly."[/color] Sanjuku said before he rushed out the door into the crowded street.

			Hitting the roofs was the smartest thing to do for the ninja as the people were no longer in his way. If he continued to stay walking within the roads he might have never made it back in time and might have failed but nevertheless the right options were taken into consideration for the genin.

Upon arrival of his several block endeavor, he would notice a beautiful white house with a white picket fence and a red door. The window sills were all painted a darker shade of blue and a beautiful woman stood outside it watering her flower garden. She was even humming a nice tune to herself as she tended to her small field.

Her hair was red, face tanned, and a beautiful white dress was on her back.

			Sanjuku lept from rooftop to rooftop as quickly as possible, trying to save as much time as he could. He finally reached the address he was told to deliver to, and noticed the women tending to her flowers. He would've liked to stay and make a little smalltalk, as the woman seemed very sweet at first glance, but he was on a schedule and he had to stick to it. He walked over and got the woman's attention by lightly tapping her on the shoulder, saying [color=#090]"Excuse me miss, I was instructed to deliver this package to your address, could you please take this?"[/color] as he handed her the package. If the woman would accept the package, he would give a quick smile and nod, then rush back to the office as fast as possible.

			The woman would feel a bit surprised and shocked as she was interrupted by a small ninja boy and handing her a brown package. She could only smile happily as she held the box tightly against her chest before thanking the boy and running as quickly as she could into the front door of her house. The door would slam shut behind her and the sounds of her voice screaming within the house could be heard outside of it.

Back at the office, the employer waited for the ninja with ten letters. Five of the ten were in brown envelopes and were all needed to be shipped to the same address. The other five were all destined to go to different houses that had addresses next to each other. The destination seemed to be a bit far. Almost a mile out.

[b]"If you wanna be a super star you can carry those five packages too because they are a block away from the other houses for the envelopes!"[/b] he would point to 5 large boxes that were roughly 4x4x4 each in feet. [b]"They are heavy and very breakable! Its your head if any of them break!"[/b] he waited for the decision of the boy before handing him the paperwork for directions.

			As much as Sanjuku wanted to be the best there is, he was no fool, and without a proper method of transportation, he would be at a loss for how to carry those packages without the fear of breaking them. [color=#ee4a2d]"It's not that i don't want to take them, but how would i guarantee they won't break? Do you have something i could use to ensure their safe delivery?"[/color] Sanjuku would be gathering the letters into his pouch as he asked this question, and based on his employer's answer, may or may not take the packages with him.

			The owner of the mail store was somewhat enlightened that the boy was starting to use his head It was showing some sort of promise that he wasn't all just some loser with a not so great attitude as he let out a smile before tossing a ring of keys to the boy. [b]"If you go out toward the back you will see a large red wagon! If you think your smart enough to use it than I would not mind you going ahead and taking it on!"[/b] he would let out a smirk as the keys would have about twenty of them on the ring.

The room in the back was guarded by a large black door, hopefully matching a black key. It was actually a garage, and there was a giant red wagon with dust just chilling in the dead center of the room.

The rainy skies cast down on the village as the sounds of thunder clapping and the bright flashes of white lightning was the only source of light that came across the sky. This was known as the village of Kumogakure no Sato. The sad fact is that all people who lived in this area were all used to these types of things and situations happening and could care less about the matter.

A farmer stood in his trench coat waiting for a ninja to appear as his eyes shifted back and forth around the area. It was obvious there was something bothering him and why wouldn't their be when his farm, that was normally filled with bulls and calfs, was nearly empty except for a few shuriken and kunai that were lying in the pits.

His coat was yellow, and his boots were black. His hair was red and his skin was paled and freckled. He waited for his rescuer.

			Tokaido arrived at the farm he was told to go to in order to meet the person who hired him. From the looks of things, the man was a farmer of some sorts. He saw no crops in the man's fields, instead seeing signs of grazing. however, he saw no cattle, and noticed a few stray kunai laying in the dirt. As he approached the man wearing the yellow coat, he spoke with a serious tone. [color=#090]"Hello, my name is Tokaido. I was told to meet you here, and that i would be told my mission upon arrival. What seems to be the problem?"[/color] Tokaido stood about 5 feet away from the man, keeping a hand near his shuriken holster.

			The ginger farmer looked down at the chuunin and realized that he was going to have a real hard time leaving all of his precious cattle to one person. It was almost like a suicide mission but if the raikage was able to let that go within his head than it was obvious that the man would have to trust him as well. Nevertheless there was more important things to worry about like his precious bulls, the village, and those evil genin that have been tormenting his animals for the longest time now.

[b]"Well now, yes there is a problem sir! You see there are these three genin and they have been terrorizing my bulls for the longest time! They made them all escape and they are now on a four mile run toward the village which is dangerous!"[/b] he started to speak frantically. [b]"Questions?!"[/b] he would shout.

It was obvious which way the bulls went as tracks and falling down trees were all headed north.

			Tokaido had no idea who these genin were, but hopefully this man could tell him something about them. [color=#090]"So, you want me to bring back your bulls, which are currently on a warpath to Kumo, and take care of the genin terrorizing your fields. Can you give me any information about the Genin, like their weapons, affinities, specialties? And the bulls, is there anything special I should know about them that might help me bring them back?"[/color]

After the man had said everything he could, Tokaido would leave without a word, following the tracks laid by the bulls going north. He would attempt to stay somewhat hidden, ducking behind any trees still standing whenever possible, as he didn't want any genin getting the drop on him. He did however keep a good pace, as the bulls heading for Kumo had a good lead on him, and he needed to catch up.

			The old man put his hand to his mouth as he started to think about what exactly it was that the genin used. [b]"Well erm. for starters, there is this one that used a little fire cracker explosion that actually made the bulls go all running about. It wasn't a very fun time and well the others were all using them ninja weapons that are sharp to get them to run in the directions that they wanted. I think there was another using special magic powers but I forgot exactly it was what he was doing."[/b] he shrugged as he would look up to see the ninja walk away.

While walking down the path he would see trees broken down, and would continue to see ninja tools along the ground. If he were open minded he would hear very loud panting coming from no more than 10 meters to his east. If he went to go look he would see a bull resting behind a bush, almost sleeping as it were still.

			As Tokaido walked along the path of destruction left by the bulls, he took close notice of the ninja toole saw scattered along the ground. Kunai and Shuriken being his weapon of choice, he took note of the amount of tools he saw. He continued to follow the path a bit farther when he heard panting coming from a bush to his right. Upon closer examination, he found a bull, seemingly asleep. He approached the bull, and after performing a few quick handseals, pressed his hands to the bulls head to jolt it awake. After waking the bull, he would take a quick step away from the animal, in case of spooking it. if it wasn't spooked, he would try to send it back down the path to its owner, then continue in pursuit of the stampede.

Jutsu usedShow *[Lightning Element• Shock Treatment]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the proper hand seals, the user's hands become electrically charged and they are able to use small currents of electricity to wake up someone who was knocked out. To add to this, these charges can stimulate the brain of someone who's conscious. This stimulation can wake those drifting to sleep or momentarily get rid of any grogginess caused by fatigue for four posts. This jutsu can’t bring targets out of genjutsu, however nor can it add wit.

			It probably wasn't the smartest thing to do to wake a sleeping bull as its eyes jolted open and started to buck around the space it laid in frantically. It was scared from teh feeling and started to hit its horns against the trees before it would catch your eye, rubbing its hooves against the ground as it looked as it if it was going to charge you with full force.

OOC; sory short post. tired.

			heheh. Tokaido should've thought a bit more about that move, as the bull went ballistic, Tokaido quickly thought of a way to stop the bull from goring his insides out. He would find a couple trees close enough together for his technique, then after forming his handseals, he would create a thin electric wire between the two trees, and taunt the bull to attack. If the bull would run into the wire, it would buy Tokaido enough time to make his escape from the bull, and continue along the warpath left by the other bulls.

Jutsu usedShow *[Lightning Element • Electric Wire Technique]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

The user creates a wire of electricity between their hands. This wire can be placed between two objects, like two trees or two rocks that are up to 10 meters apart. The user has to touch one of the objects and then drag the Raiton wire to the other object and attach it there. Upon being touched, the wire can trip targets while also delivering a painful shock to the limb that touched it, followed by paralysis to said limb. The paralysis lasts for one post, and the wire can sustain itself for up to 4 posts or until dismissed.

OOC; yeah, maybe i shouldn't have woken him up. bad move.

			The bull began to franti more and more as it was starting to be taunted. ITs hooves were kicking into every bush and its horns were plowing into every tree. It was definitely not having a good time as it watched some kind of static come from the human, its eyes destined for killing as i ran straight forward into a trap that it did not even see coming, tripping onto its head and laying stiffly on the ground. It couldn't stop itself or even better try to make itself get off the ground because it was stuck, but for how long?

It stared at you angrily, though sad at the same time as it sensed death coming near. On a side note, the path to destruction was still headed a long ways out and only hoof marks were on the road, all except for a thin web that was starting to show along the trees next to some kunai.

			Tokaido's technique shouldn't be enough to kill the poor thing, as it was only meant to paralyze it for his escape. That knowledge in mind, Tokaido would leave the bull to its own end in favor of his pursuit of the rampage. as he followed the path of destruction, he took notice of the web that was strung along the treeline. he would not get close enough to touch them, for fear of a trap of some sort, but he would give them some closer inspection so as to find the nature of their creation.

			Taking a deep look into the webbing that was found on the ground would prove to be fruitful. AFter much close examination of it, a source of chakra would emanate from it, though the feeling would not be all that great. The webbing would also be much more sticky than that of a normal web that no small spider could ever produce. It was surely something strange that was coming from it.

			Arsenal sat on a large mountain ledge identical in height to him. He was at the base of the village mountains, in the exact gathering address from the letter his father gave him. Beside the genin was a river that flowed down the mountain like a weak waterfall. It lead into the sea that surrounded the training ground's edge. The air was nice and cool with some slight breeze. Skyward at the mountain's pinnacle, it was cloudy. The sky itself was a baby blue hue. Arsenal was dressed in his usual shinobi garbs, his silver short/long jumpsuit, armed with his tool pouch and holster, with his fresh and undamaged forehead protector strapped around his upper left thigh. He was in the cultivation to meet up with his new comrades.

"Cells already?" stated Arsenal, stunned when his father handed him a letter earlier in the morning. "I only been a genin for a day."

His father went on to tell the boy how proud he was of him. He had a bad tendency for doing that. It annoyed the teen yet still brought a smile to his face every time. He ended it with more: Not to worries! And to do your bests!

Heh, Arsenal laughed at the memory while closing his eyes.

I wont let you down, he thought while crossing his legs and leaning back against the mountain, relaxing with his hands behind his head. He nonchalantly waited for his unknown allies.

			Madoka couldn’t contain his beaming smile as he bounded down the mountainside. This month he had been promoted to Chunin, turned 15 and now was about to be placed on a new specialty squad. His shaggy hair was rustled into a state of complete disarray from the momentum of his hasty movements coupled with the familiar breeze that travelled through the rugged mountainside. As he neared his destination the boy slowed himself, taking deep breaths of the crisp invigorating air in order to quell his racing heartbeat.

He had never been very physical fit and he didn’t want to appear disheveled and out of breath on his first meeting. His hands ran through his hair, combing it in place with his fingers. The motion reminded him of his mothers chastising and nagging him to cut his hair, which brought a rebellious smirk to his face. He had grown it out longer than usual in the last few weeks, a symbol of growing independence since being promoted to Chunin.

He wore his newly aquired vest proudly, the vivid white material complimenting his black and white attire perfectly. Everything about his attire was balanced perfectly between black and white, he even wore opposite colored gloves and carried a pole intertwined with both shades. Some might deem his garb odd but Madoka had always been one to stand out.

Not too far ahead he noticed a boy about his own age, waiting on a ledge. He picked up his speed once more to come within range, [color=#fff]“Hiya, I’m Yamamoto Madoka! I guess we’re teammates!” [/color]he greeted somewhat loudly with a boyish grin plastered across his face. His excitement was welling up within him and it was hard to contain, he looked around anxiously for the rest of his squad mates.

			Nui had managed to get a decent nights sleep for a change, probably from having left the bar early last night after some asshole attempted to feel her up. She had left him with black eye, a gash from a broken bottle, and lump on his noggin from where she had rammed his head into the bar. As she slipped out of her bed she scratched her head and yawned before standing up and making her way toward the bathroom.

She was showered and a helluva lot more agreeable person but the minute she saw a reminder to meet the rest of the new team she swore loudly and multiple times as she blamed the village for cutting into a perfect time to go back to sleep. After she had a beer from her fridge, she dried herself off and started to get ready to meet this team.

She tied her hair back and saw she had forgotten to do laundry, again, leaving her with her mission attire. She normally wouldn't mind wearing it, but she knew that [i]he[/i] was gonna be there and make all sorts of stupid passes at her. Normally she didn't mind passes, but this guy was trying to hard. Grabbing her mission clothes, Nui started to get dressed as she slide into her tight body suit and fastened the collar around her neck to keep it in place.

Her jacket contrasted well with her body suit and after presented some kind of assumption Nui had fashion sense. Making sure her knife was in its sheath on the shoulder of the jacket, the woman donned the fingerless gloves and sandals that would top off her attire before reaching for her belt. She was walking out her door as she fastened around her waist and then let it hang diagonally across her hips as she walked outside.

Needless to say a few peopel were already noticing her as she made her way through the village. Yet the closer she got to the meeting point, the more she felt a foul presence in the air. "[color=brown]Crap, he must be nearby.[/color]" She muttered to herself before she started descending toward the designated location. She saw a pair of people there already and as she approached she saw they were both young. She had heard there was only one genin on the team and was about to ask who when she noticed the vest on one as she got closer.

"[color=brown]You two must be the rest of the team I heard about. Now all we need is Mr. Testosterone and we can get down to business.[/color]" She said flatly as she approached the two younger members. '[i][color=brown]Fuck, they better not have made me the only woman in this sausage fest. I'm starting to think this is punishment more than anything.[/color][/i]'

Nui had managed to get a decent nights sleep for a change, probably from having left the bar early last night after some asshole attempted to feel her up. She had left him with black eye, a gash from a broken bottle, and lump on his noggin from where she had rammed his head into the bar. As she slipped out of her bed she scratched her head and yawned before standing up and making her way toward the bathroom.

She was showered and a helluva lot more agreeable person but the minute she saw a reminder to meet the rest of the new team she swore loudly and multiple times as she blamed the village for cutting into a perfect time to go back to sleep. After she had a beer from her fridge, she dried herself off and started to get ready to meet this team.

She tied her hair back and saw she had forgotten to do laundry, again, leaving her with her mission attire. She normally wouldn't mind wearing it, but she knew that [i]he[/i] was gonna be there and make all sorts of stupid passes at her. Normally she didn't mind passes, but this guy was trying to hard. Grabbing her mission clothes, Nui started to get dressed as she slide into her tight body suit and fastened the collar around her neck to keep it in place.

Her jacket contrasted well with her body suit and after presented some kind of assumption Nui had fashion sense. Making sure her knife was in its sheath on the shoulder of the jacket, the woman donned the fingerless gloves and sandals that would top off her attire before reaching for her belt. She was walking out her door as she fastened around her waist and then let it hang diagonally across her hips as she walked outside.

Needless to say a few peopel were already noticing her as she made her way through the village. Yet the closer she got to the meeting point, the more she felt a foul presence in the air. "[color=brown]Crap, he must be nearby.[/color]" She muttered to herself before she started descending toward the designated location. She saw a pair of people there already and as she approached she saw they were both young. She had heard there was only one genin on the team and was about to ask who when she noticed the vest on one as she got closer.

"[color=brown]You two must be the rest of the team I heard about. Now all we need is Mr. Testosterone and we can get down to business.[/color]" She said flatly as she approached the two younger members. '[i][color=brown]Fuck, they better not have made me the only woman in this sausage fest. I'm starting to think this is punishment more than anything.[/color][/i]'

			Today was the day. The day Tokaido was to meet the team he would be working with, according to the village's orders. He still wasn't particularly thrilled with being forced onto a team, but that girl, Nui Ishiguro, helped to keep him interested. He had been practicing a bit more then often lately, mainly due to having to take this team seriously, other people's lives were on the line on a team, and everyone has to be at the top of their game. Because of this, he still had his mission outfit on, complete with black vest, red pants, Shuriken holster belt, Boots and pouches carrying his weapons. This was his normal training attire as well, though he did clean himself up before heading to the meeting place.

As he Neared the training ground near the bottom of the mountain, he could see from a pretty far distance the 3 people now gathered around talking. Upon closer inspection, he realized one of them was definitely Nui. [color=#090]"Well, looks like I made it on time. It looks like Nui is already getting to know our team... guess i better get down there then."[/color] Tokaido said aloud to himself as he continued his approach to the training ground. As he got closer, he realized that it looked like there were 2 Genin at first, until he noticed the vest one of them had on.[color=#090][i]"interesting...Must be a new Chuunin, i've never seen this guy before."[/i][/color]

Tokaido, Now within about 30 ft of the group, Noticed Nui was already starting in on him with the boys, no doubt making some comment at his expense. She really didn't like him it seemed... But he wasn't about to quit just because of that little detail. [color=#090]"Hey there, looks like were all gathered together. I'm Hideyoshi Tokaido, Expert ranged combatant and long range spotter."[/color] He stood over by Nui as he spoke, mainly speaking to the two that he didn't yet know. [color=#090]According to the villages orders, it appears we will be working together on a team. Let's try not to rip each other's heads off... either of them."[/color] His last comment was specifically targeted at Nui, as he looked straight at her when he said it.

			Arsenal's eyes shot open. He managed to fall asleep within the short time he laid on the mountain ledge. Which wasn't a surprise. He wasn't lazy . . . well not [i]that lazy.[/i] The genin just wasn't a morning person. More of the sleep in type, ya know? He was especially tired this morning considering the day before. It was his first day as a genin and his father interrupted his free day by making him train at 7 AM, then his mother tried to stop him from being a shinobi, afterwards his sister annoyed him, and lastly his hangout session with his all time crush was interrupted by her brother/his rival. Now this morning some dude woke him up with all this loud talking around him. Arsenal observed him before rising his torso and knee to lean on. The male looked around the same age as him. But his personality was a bit, childish. It reminded him of his sister who brought the genin great annoyance. His agitation was probably sensible in the air. He prepared to say something to the comrade but at that moment he realized a woman arrived.

"Mister Testosterone?" Reiterated Arsenal with an utter and raised brow.

The woman's voice felt firm to him, therefor coming off somewhat strict. Arsenal already didn't like that. He didn't like the idea of two mothers. Then another, Mister Testosterone he supposed, appeared. So far Testosterone-Sensei was the only one of the cell he liked. Expert ranged combatant and long range spotter? So bauss.

"So," Arsenal stood up on the ledge, he's gaze rolling from shinobi to shinobi. "Two genin, a chuunin, and a jounin? Wait--"

His father told him about how cells work. Genin like himself were put together with chuunin like his old man and super cool jounin like the Raikage. As he mentioned the two genin he pointed a thumb to himself and tried to causally place a hand on Madoka's shoulder. The two were exactly the same height from what Arsenal could tell, he figured the dude was a genin like him. He then pointed at the girl when addressing the chuunin. She was older, and a [i]girl.[/i] If there were chuunin and jounin, she would have to be chuunin. Though her being a genin wouldn't be surprising. Maybe that's why she gave that sour taste to the atmosphere? Mad she hasn't ranked up yet? Meh . . . And of course, Testies-Sensei had to be the jounin. He described himself as Arsenal's ideal shinobi. After that thought and mentioning the jounin, the boy's jaw dropped, humorously dripping drool as his eyes wided into stars.

"--you're not Raikage-sama, are you?" he asked of Tokaido with astonishment.

			Madoka waited patiently for a response from his teammate. He didn’t say anything however and the way he got up seemed to indicate that he had been sleeping, [color=#fff]“Hey, were you sleeping?” [/color]he asked curiously, completely oblivious of Arsenals annoyance. Before the other boy had a chance to answer however a woman appeared and began speaking. [color=#000][i]Woah, where did she come from?[/i][/color] he wondered as she spoke. She seemed older and quite serious, her presence alone seemed to both excite and terrify him. He was only just beginning to take an interest in women and as such he couldn’t quite decipher exactly what it was that caused him to feel that way. His eyes did a quick scan of her, [color=#000][i]Probably a Chunin[/i][/color], he concluded by the way she held herself. Then he noticed her eyes. For a moment he marvelled at the beauty of the gorgeous black on white eyes. He envied them wholeheartedly, wishing that he had eyes as magnificent as those [color=#000][i]The Kanpagan of the Ishiguro clan[/i] [/color], he knew instantly. He had read about the clan and their Doujutsu many times but had never had the privilege to view it in person. He was about to make a comment when the final member of the squad arrived.

His admiration suddenly shifted to the newcomer. Like arsenal his first assumption was that Tokaido was a Jounin. He couldn’t imagine that a man carrying as much presence as he could possibly be the same rank as him. He stood nearly a foot taller and was a self-proclaimed expert at long-range combat. At the very least he must be a Special Jounin. His eyes lit up and his smile grew even wider,[color=#fff] “Yamamoto Madoka, it’s a pleasure to meet all of you”[/color] he declared, his voice exhumed excitement but also great respect and admiration. He even followed up his statement with a polite bow.

[/quote]

Suddenly the Genin was at Madoka’s side, unfortunately Madoka had been too caught up in his introduction and admiration to catch most of the gestures that accompanied the boy’s assumptions. Two Genin? Madoka looked around, trying to find the second Genin, [color=#fff]“Wha, where? She’s a ge?” [/color]he began, pointing to Nui, assuming that she must be the person that Arsenal was referring to. Then he realized the other boy’s mistake. The befuddled look suddenly vanished from Madoka’s visage, replaced by a wide grin a moment before he burst into laughter. A few seconds later he collected himself and placed a hand on the genin’s shoulder, [color=#fff]“I think you need to wipe the sleep out of your eyes” [/color], he teased playfully, [color=#fff]“I’m a Chunin!” [/color]he declared with a tone of great pride. His thumb jabbed into his vest in affirmation of his statement.

The boy seemed to have other things on his mind however. His attention was on Tokaido whom he had apparently mistaken for the Raikage. Madoka had certainly deemed the man impressive looking but not to that extent. If he considered the situation a moment longer he would have recalled from his readings that the true Raikage looked nothing like this man. In his heart Madoka knew this but he decided to play along anyway, he didn’t want his teammate to feel stupid. [color=#fff]“Really? Are you sure? No way?!”[/color] he blurted out in an enthusiastic manner. He proceeded to gawk at the man as if he truly was the Raikage. The other boy believed it after all, and who was Madoka to tell him that he was wrong?

No way?!”[/color] he blurted out in an enthusiastic manner. He proceeded to gawk at the man as if he truly was the Raikage. The other boy believed it after all, and who was Madoka to tell him that he was wrong?

			"[color=brown]That's why I carry a knife, who needs to rip when slicing it off is so much easier.[/color]" Nui stated while drawing her sharp Tactical knife and pointing it at Tokaido in a lax manner. It was then the other two opened their mouths. Nui switched her glare from Tokaido to the other two members of the team. "[color=brown]I'd better not have to wave this knife at you two as well. Bad enough I'm the only woman on the team but now I'm the only one who doesn't assume shit. And if this breeder is the Raikage, then I'm a goddess come to earth to smite the heathens that elected him as such.[/color]"

She pointed her knife at Tokaido again like she was merely pointing to him "[color=brown]He and I are both chuunin. You![/color]" Nui pointed her knife at Madoka, "[color=brown]The vest makes you chuunin unless you're wearing it to fuck with people, in which I'd 'ask' you to take it off. And you, genin boy! Introduce yourself already.[/color]" Nui finished up before shoving her knife back into the sheath from whence it came. "[color=brown]And before I have someone getting my ass about it, I'm Ishiguro Nui. Specialist of Denjiton, Mind's Eye, and Taijutsu. I'd be happy to demonstrate them on [i]Tokaido[/i].[/color]"

Nui seemed to say his name with a bit of spit as she crossed her arms under her chest. needless to say, this was looking to be a less amazing prospect as things went on. Then again she could also vent herself with some training, especially against the younger ones. They never were as skilled as her. Of course she still had to kick Tokaido's ass during a training session sometime just to relieve some tension.

			[color=#090]"Haha, there wont be any need for that Nui, we're all friends here."[/color] Tokaido didn't want to start in on her immediately, but he planned to make quite a few comments at Nui's expense. First things first though, he needed to address the rest of his team, he had met Nui previously and needed to familiarize himself with his younger members. [color=#090]"To answer your question though, no i'm not the raikage, haha. But yes, i am a chuunin, much like Nui and Madoka over there."[/color] he said pointing to the Chuunin in the vest. [color=#090]"That makes you,"[/color] he said pointing to the genin on the rock, [color=#090]"the lowest rank on the team. Not that there is anything wrong with that, you have to start somewhere right?"[/color]

Tokaido liked this team so far, but to get a better grasp of their capabilities, he would need to see them fight. He wouldn't be able to formulate any form of plan or basis for the team until then. [color=#090]"In any case, for today i propose we take it easy, and just get to know each other a little better. You're only as good as your team, and if you don't KNOW your team... well you might as well not be on one."[/color]

Tokaido took a breath before starting on a bit of a description of himself. [color=#090]"Well, as i said, my name is Hideyoshi Tokaido. My nickname is Farshot, but i try not to go by that normally, Tokaido or Sensei is fine. I have very simple likes: Beautiful women and my weapon training. I carry over 100 throwing weapons at most times, but at the least i carry a few kunai and my shuriken holsters. I also use Raiton jutsu as a means of close range combat should i ever need it. More importantly though, i want to learn Jikiton and eventually become a skyguard. Okay, whos Next?"[/color] Tokaido motioned around, pointing with a kunai knife at whoever was the next person to talk about themselves.

			What? Arsenal jerked his neck back as his face contorted with confusion. Tokaido wasn't the Raikage? Not even a Jounin? He couldn't believe what he was hearing. The man's appearance even fooled the other chuu . . . chuunin?

"CHUUNIN!?" He shouted to both Madokai and Tokaiso, his head weaving back and forth to gawk at them.

"Whoa," said Arsenal, breath taken. "I need some time to process this." His reply was mainly for Nui when she ordered him to address himself. He was speechless at the moment. Once Tokaido and the female finished there introduction, the sensei's kunai pointed at Arsenal. He had to say something now.

"Meh, I'm Fuuma, Dememaru. The genin known as Arsenal-Sama and the official cell leader!"

The genin locked eyes with Nui.

"Now, I wouldn't mind seeing your abilities. I heard of neither Denjition nor Mind Eye. What are they?" The boys words were more of an order but he did ask a sincere question.

			Madoka visibly gulped, instinctively straightening his posture when Nui yelled at him. Terrified; now he knew he was definitely terrified of this woman. [color=#000][i]Tokaido’s a Chunin and don’t piss of Nui[/i], [/color]he noted, hoping to not make either mistake again.

His racing heart began to subside to a more natural pace as Tokaido took the floor with his introduction, the boy’s posture however remained rigid and professional. He managed to relax enough to scratch the back of his head and grin widely however when Dememaru finally realized that he was a Chunin.

He waited patiently as the rest of the team introduced themselves, leaving Madoka for last. Before he would begin his introduction however Madoka took the liberty of interjecting when Dememaru asked Nui about her clan’s abilities. In the boy’s mind this would be an ideal time for him to claim some standing with Nui, [color=#fff]“Mind’s Eye the most versatile branch of sensory styles.”[/color] He began, speaking timidly at first, then his mind delved into his readings, allowing him to act as though he were paraphrasing for an assignment. [color=#fff]“It allows one to detect chakra signals, potentially from quite some distance away. At higher levels one could even discern someone’s chakra affinity before they even display it in combat”[/color] His voice had grown stronger now, he was confident in his knowledge.[color=#fff] “But then that’s something that all members of the Ishiguro clan are capable of due to their kekkei genkai; the Kanpagan.” [/color]For a moment a hint of admiration surfaced across his visage as he allowed himself to look Nui in the eye and admire its glory. He cleared his throat, [color=#fff]“Denjiton on the other hand is a unique style, fusing Fuuton and Raiton to create distortions in chakra, effectively allowing one to disrupt ninjutsu.” [/color]Upon concluding his recitation he realized how much he had been speaking. Few people glimpsed his true intelligence, most assuming him to be nothing more than a naive child. A slight blush crept through his face, reddening his cheeks. [color=#fff]“Or, uh, something like that. My apologies for interrupting!” [/color]he added in an attempt to eliminate any haughtiness that he may have exhumed.

A few moments later he remembered, likely after being reminded, that he hadn’t actually mentioned any of his own capabilities. [color=#fff]“oh, um. Well, I focus on manipulating raw chakra but I can use Fuuton to feel vibrations around me and pick up sensory information. Mostly though I keep at a long range and support with distractions and medical ninjutsu.” [/color]He said in a much quieter and more casual tone than before. He was more comfortable talking about the abilities of others than bragging about his own capabilities.

In the boy’s mind this would be an ideal time for him to claim some standing with Nui, [color=#fff]“Mind’s Eye the most versatile branch of sensory styles.”[/color] He began, speaking timidly at first, then his mind delved into his readings, allowing him to act as though he were paraphrasing for an assignment. [color=#fff]“It allows one to detect chakra signals, potentially from quite some distance away. At higher levels one could even discern someone’s chakra affinity before they even display it in combat”[/color] His voice had grown stronger now, he was confident in his knowledge.[color=#fff] “But then that’s something that all members of the Ishiguro clan are capable of due to their kekkei genkai; the Kanpagan.” [/color]For a moment a hint of admiration surfaced across his visage as he allowed himself to look Nui in the eye and admire its glory. He cleared his throat, [color=#fff]“Denjiton on the other hand is a unique style, fusing Fuuton and Raiton to create distortions in chakra, effectively allowing one to disrupt ninjutsu.” [/color]Upon concluding his recitation he realized how much he had been speaking. Few people glimpsed his true intelligence, most assuming him to be nothing more than a naive child. A slight blush crept through his face, reddening his cheeks. [color=#fff]“Or, uh, something like that. My apologies for interrupting!” [/color]he added in an attempt to eliminate any haughtiness that he may have exhumed.

A few moments later he remembered, likely after being reminded, that he hadn’t actually mentioned any of his own capabilities. [color=#fff]“oh, um. Well, I focus on manipulating raw chakra but I can use Fuuton to feel vibrations around me and pick up sensory information. Mostly though I keep at a long range and support with distractions and medical ninjutsu.” [/color]He said in a much quieter and more casual tone than before. He was more comfortable talking about the abilities of others than bragging about his own capabilities.

			Nui's prospective rage toward the genin was mostly derailed by the younger looking Chuunin named Madoka talking. He explained Denjiton and Mind's Eye, but after all that he only covered about half her abilities. When he explained his own sensor abilities she already had an idea on how to mark targets for sniping, now she just needed to have the other guy train himself to read chakra from far away.

But getting back on track, she held up her arm, closing her fist in a manner that it cracked her knuckles audibly. "[color=brown]I also use Raiton and Taijutsu. I'm also the fastest Chuunin you'll ever see.[/color]" With that she was moving in the blink of an eye, closing the gap between her and Dememaru. When she stopped, her arm was out to the side and the bend of her elbow was less than an inch from the Genin's neck. "[color=brown]And you aren't the leader punk or the next time I will make sure you see what I can do.[/color]"

Nui backed of as she walked to the side and crossed her arms, her black eyes glaring at the Genin. As things stood, Dememaru was starting to climb the shit list and he was slowly approaching Tokaido's placing on there. If he played his cards wrong, he'd bypass Tokaido.

			OOC: I don't know if i should be posting on this but since Kyoya is a part of the team now, I thought it would be a good idea for me to post on this thread since the whole team is meeting up.

Kyoya would make it into the training grounds as he said to himself, "[color=Orangered]Well this isn't going to look good for my first day with the new cell. Hopefully I don't die for this.[/color]" As Kyoya was approaching the meeting place, he would hear someone yell that they're the official leader of the cell, he would think to himself, [i][color=Orangered]Wow this cell might is going to make me motivated for only 1 thing, killing whoever the most annoying person is in the cell.[/color][/i] Kyoya would arrive the rest of his cell, he would be next to Tokaido, and would say in a calm voice, "[color=Orangered]Sorry for being late, my family lives outside of the village and I lost track of time making sure I had all of my equipment.[/color]" Kyoya would then put his left hand on the butt of his katana and asked in the same calm voice, "[color=Orangered]What did I miss?[/color]"

			[color=#090]"Hmm, another genin it seems. Well all you missed was introductions basically. Y'know, good to get to know your team."[/color] Tokaido eyed this boy with curiosity. The sword he laid his hand on was impressively made, though he wondered if he was actually good with it. if so, that would be an excellent addition to the teams line up, making sure Nui wouldn't be the only one in the fray.

[color=#090]That's an interesting sword you've got your hands on. I take it you're a swordsman?"[/color] Tokaido was curious as to the boy's Kenjutsu style. katanas could be used for a variety of styles, and though he was an expert in tai, his Kenjutsu was par at best. It would be best to wait for the genin's reply, rather than look like a fool to guess wrong.

He shifted his attention to Dememaru, the boy with no fear it seemed. He would be wise not to upset Nui, Tokaido knew that first hand by now. He had done his research into Nui's previous team of genin, and some of her methods, and they didn't seem pleasant. [color=#090]"well, i don't know about the whole "Cell Leader" thing, but what's with the nickname? Do you carry an arsenal or something?"[/color] It was a strange name to be sure, but it seemed to be what he identified with, so he called him by it for the time being.

[color=#090]"And Nui, it seems this guy knows as much about you as you do, thats pretty smart huh?"[/color] He was actually fairly impressed by Madoka's knowledge. He sounded like a teacher from school almost, though he kind of despised that sound.

			He's smart, thought Arsenal as he listened to Madoka speak. Maybe that's how he made it to chuunin.

The young genin liked intellectual people. They seemed superior to others, and in some sense they were. But he could tell Madoka didn't think like that, not with his timid behavior. Arsenal on the other hand did have a mentality like that. He didn't act intelligent but he knew a little more than the average genin. He just liked to annoy and argue with others more than feeling smarter. In the end, winning a debate does make one feel like the top dog.

Hm? Arsenal focused back on Nui as she spoke. Fastest chuunin he'd ever see? He figured he knew two already swifter. His father and Tokaido. "Heh, yeah ri--" Arsenal froze as Nui and her elbow appeared out of thin air before him. "Uh, uh, hello there . . ." He uttered right before falling back on his rear. As Nui backed off and paced off to the side he felt her eyes on him. It was very uncomfortable. Arsenal began having doubts his father could even match that speed. Tokaido even. But even worse than that, he wasn't cell leader . . .

Arsenal's eyes widened. He saw another shinobi around his height and age beside testosterone-sensei and he wore no flak jacket.

"GENIN!?" shouted Arsenal questionably, he jumped up to point at the male in the process. "You're a genin, right?"

His eyes then slightly turned over to Tokaido as he continued to point at the newcomer. Arsenal smiled.

"Because I, um, used to sneak off and toy with the academy weapon arsenal . . . but, um, yeah, [i]more importantly,[/i] I'm a weapon specialist," the teen stated smugly as he stood up straight and pointed a thumb to himself. "I'm second to none! . . . but you . . . I guess." He quickly reached for his shuriken holster attached to his thigh and grabbed one.

"Go on!" He continued to bark proudly. "Give me a target, I'll hit it without fail! Make it a moving one too! No, make it several moving targets!"

			Madoka watched with uneasiness as ‘Arsenal’ continued to prod Nui. [color=#000][i]This won’t end well[/i][/color], he mused, though he knew better than to draw any attention to himself at the moment. And then it happened. In a burst of speed Nui put the Genin in his place, right on his butt. [color=#fff]“w..whoah”[/color] he muttered in disbelief and a marginal degree of fear. And then he realized that as of yet he was the only one whom the woman hadn’t displayed aggression towards “Very impressive Nui-Sama” he blurted out, his voice cracking mid-speech. His face colored once more, causing him to place a hand behind his head nervously.

To his relief a boy with a sword arrived at that moment, diverting the attention away from himself. Madoka quickly spun to his right, promptly placing his hands at his sides. [color=#fff]“Yamamoto Madoka” [/color]he introduced for the third time now as he bowed slightly in respect to the new teammate. He waited to hear the boys name as the others dominated the conversation.

He perked up however when Dememaru asked for targets so that he could perform some sort of weapons demonstration. [color=#fff]“Oh! I know!” [/color]he declared excitedly as his hands flew into seals.[color=#fff] “I bet you can’t hit these guys”[/color] he challenged through a boyish grin as his chakra seeped out of him, coalescing into 5 entities of translucent black chakra. They appeared in the air around him, quickly forming into the likeness of crows. They cawed noisily and flapped their wings, circling overhead in a wild frenzy though not a single noise was made by their wings nor did the motion stir up any breeze. With the flick of a finger they darted through the sky at a speed that surpassed even Nui’s, circling, dipping and criss- crossing over each other but staying within 30ft or so of the group. Even if the boy managed to hit one of the crows however it would appear as though he didn’t as the attack would pass right through the black chakra entities.

Jutsu UsedShow[b]Chakra Crows[/b]

B-Rank Ninjutsu

Utilizing Yin saturated chakra Madoka is able to create a murder of 20 intangible crows. These crows can act as single unit in order to channel D or C-Ranked Genjutsu. Only one Genjutsu may be used at a time however and Madoka must form a hand seal each time in order to channel the chakra. If the original trigger of the genjutsu is visual based seeing the crows will act as a supplementary trigger whereas if it was audio based then the cawing of the crows will act as the trigger. These crows disperse after 4 posts and cannot travel more than 1km from Madoka, though they must be within 100ft for them to be able to channel genjutsu. Physical attacks are ineffective against the crows, simply passing right through them; however elemental jutsu will cause them to disperse.

			Her hint had gotten through and yet another new face had shown itself. This team was growing, but sadly it had gained another genin. One look at him told Nui he was gonna be working with her. How could she tell? The sword. Unless you love carrying around a three foot piece of metal dead weight, you were someone who could use a sword. She hoped he wasn't like the Dememaru kid at the least.

"[color=brown]Smart? The Ishiguro have been around for a while, we're not exactly new. Only people that don't pay attention don't know about them.[/color]" Nui said before Arsenal started boasting and wanted a target to hit. Nui was about to make herself a living target when the other Chuunin, Madoka, started forming hand seals as he beat her to the punch. The noisy flying pests he made moved with a speed about the same as hers from what she could calculate. She would know, she's done her share of racing against Jounin and when it comes to speed, she knew her shit.

"[color=brown]Do they have to be that noisy?[/color]" Nui asked as she winced. She never liked birds, something about them always irritated her. Maybe it was because one of her brothers was dedicated to using birds and bird summons. Or was that a teammate from her Genin team? She can never remember, especially since she doesn't contact her family much since they're usually busy with missions and the like. "[color=brown]New kid, I assume you're a swordsman so that means you're with me. You'd better be fast or you're not gonna be able to keep up, ya hear me? Once you give us all your name, Mr. Testosterone there can start relaying the purpose of the team unless he plans to push that duty onto me like some other things he wishes he could do.[/color]"

			Kyoya would close his eyes and would reply to Tokaido and Nui's question, "[color=Orangered]Yes I'm a swordsman, I'm learning Iaido Kenjutsu.[/color]" He would pause as he opened his eyes and looked at Nui and continued to say, "[color=Orangered]I am pretty fast for a genin, probably faster than the loud mouth there.[/color]" Kyoya would reference Arsenal when he said loud mouth. Kyoya would then say to everyone in the cell, "[color=Orangered]My name is Naraka Kyoya by the way, mind if I ask you guys your names please? Besides Madoka who introduced himself on impulse I guess.[/color]"

			Ahh, Iaido style. Tokaido had heard of the style on a few different occasions. The speed required to properly use that style basically ensured that him and Nui would be around the same level of skill, give or take a few years due to Kyoya being a genin. [color=#090]"Good, then it seems we have a pretty solid team right here. Well, since you missed it, my name is Tokaido Hideyoshi. I specialize in throwing weapons of all sorts, specifically long ranged shots. I think i'm beginning to see the village's plan here."[/color] Tokaido said as he pondered the 4 people around him. The birds that madoka released didn't really phase Tokaido, as he was too busy in thought with this team's composition.

Nui and Kyoya both specialized in speedy combat, while him and Dememaru both specialized in ranged weaponry. Madoka would make an excellent support to the team with his Iijutsu and Genjutsu, plus a sensor was always a good thing to have.  Finally, after closing his eyes for a bit and thinking hard about it, he started. [color=#090]"Alright, so this team has a pretty good setup to work with. Nui, you and Kyoya will be the "spotters" of the group, using your speed as a mean of distraction and close range combat. Me and Dememaru, or arsenal, are the long range "snipers" so to speak, taking people out from a distance with a combination of accuracy and suppressing fire. Madoka, your role is pretty obviously one of support, using your Iijutsu, sensing, and Genjutsu to back us up however possible. If anyone has any problems with this, speak up now, because after today i think it's pretty much set in stone."[/color].

Tokaido finally paused after his speech to his team. Mr. testosterone could be serious when he wanted to be, and it was visible in his glance, which almost completely changed to look a bit more like Nui's serious glare. He took the lives of his teammates very seriously, and wanted to be sure that everyone was happy with their positions in the team. Specifically, he watched Nui like a hawk, trying to discern how she felt about all of this. Being that she was the other lead combatant, her opinion was one of the more valued, though of course everyone was important. It was easy to see she wasn't thrilled about Dememaru, but she seemed to like the fact that he was being serious for a change.

			Arsenal created a pfft sound from his lips. As if I know anything about clans, Arsenal thought. Not like I'm in one . . . He began to wonder if he was in one, he would have known if he was, right? So probably not was his conclusion.

His body quickly straighten up as Madoka taunted him. "Can't hit what?" he asked as he turned to the chuunin, his eyes dulling into seriousness. He watched Madoka summon  . . . crows? Amazing. The genin never seen a summoning before, he only heard of it from his father. Unfortunately for Madoka the crows were all about to be struck. What a waste of a summoning contract.

Arsenal stood perfectly still with his hand in his shuriken holster. He was studying the birds and their movements. They were loud and hella fast to say the least. He glanced towards Madoka with eyes that seemed to say: Why couldn't you give me something easier? With targets that swift he might as well be hitting Nui, a fun thought none the less, but he toyed with her enough for one day. Besides, he did ask for it.

"Okay," said Arsenal after a deep breath. His focus was back on the crows. He stood there for another minute or two focusing on one that just finished a turn and continued in a straight path. "Now!" he shouted, swiftly removing a shuriken and casting it towards a bird. It surely struck the target but passed straight through it.

"What?" He uttered with his face contorted in disgust and riddlement. Arsenal wasted no time to reach for three more shuriken and project them all one at a time. Aiming for targets like the last crow. "I missed? There's just no way." The genin was in a state of calm rage, frustration, and unbelief. He knew there was not a chance he missed, maybe his eyes deceived him? He practiced this shot with his father since he first grew a liking to tools. The three shuriken, like the last, hit their mark against the birds. Though each passed through like before.

"Madoka," Arsenal firmly stated. "What did you do?" It may have been a joke but the trick, if one, was hurting the teen's ego. Of course he wouldn't show it and laugh if there was.

And with all of this, Arsenal was to busy to acknowledge the kid who called him a loud mouth.

Once Testosterone-sensei began to speak up Arsenal turned to him and listened. With a smile he nodded. Arsenal had no objection . . . though it would have been nice if he was the cell leader. Bah . . .

Jutsu UsedShow
*Sighting

D-Rank Taijutsu

Prerequisite: Wit 4

After many hours of training with ranged weaponry, the user is much better able to estimate distances and track moving targets in hectic situations. Such assessments become completely instinctive, allowing the user to change targets seemlessly without losing time between attacks. This technique forms the basis for many of the other techniques in this style.

*Prediction Shot

C-Rank Taijutsu

Prerequisite: Sighting

Relying on the ability to discern distance and track targets, the user makes a ranged attack on a moving target. Assuming that the target's speed and direction remain the same, shots made with this technique "lead" the correct amount to almost certainly strike true.

			Madoka grinned when Arsenal seemed to balk at the impressive speed of the crows. Maybe this would be what the Genin needed to subdue his arrogant and pontificating tendencies. Madoka didn’t want to embarrass him though, as such his crows moved in a uniform and predictable enough pattern despite the impressive speed in which they travelled. In truth their movements were so fast that Madoka had difficulty keeping up with them, [color=#fff]“Oh, I thought you had that one!”[/color] he exclaimed, he honestly couldn’t tell if the Genin had missed or not.

The second set of shuriken definitely hit their mark, [color=#fff]“Wow, three at once. You really are good!”[/color] he said, marvelling at them as they each intercepted the paths of the ragtag murder of crows. He then noticed that the Genin seemed to be growing frustrated, [color=#fff]“Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that they aren’t real crows, they aren’t genjutsu either though”[/color] he explained. With a half seal all but one of the crows dispersed, the last one flying in to ‘land’ on Madoka’s hand. Upon closer inspection one would note that the crow seemed off, it lacked any texture and it’s ‘feathers’ were less detailed than a real birds. [color=#fff]“They’re a composition of Yin natured chakra”[/color] as he spoke he passed his other hand right through the bird for emphasis. [color=#fff]“I came up with it myself"[/color], he added proudly.

			Nui smirked as she walked over beside Kyoya and threw her arm around his shoudlers, pulling his head close, almost dangerously one might think, to her chest. "[color=brown]I'm liking this kid a little, so long as he doesn't wind up like the rest of these pansies, he should turn out fine. Try to keep up kid cause you're gonna be my back up. We'll need to train later so I can show you the ropes.[/color]" Nui said to him as she kept her arm around him. Looking over at Tokaido she didn't seem all too impressed with his attempt at seriousness.

"[color=brown]That small degree of talk doesn't make you any less of a lecher. Frankly, you ain't gonna impress anyone with talk. Actions always speak louder.[/color]" With that she turned to Madoka, having ignored Arsenal and his exchange of showboating. "[color=brown]Oi, bird boy! Make sure you work on those sensor skills. I'm gonna come up with a way to mark the targets so they can be sensed easier from a distance. Cause if I don't mark these guys, I fear our so called snipers might not know who to take down.[/color]" Nui stated.

The team's purpose was clear and their abilities would need refining, especially the sniper set if they planned to be all that useful. Still, her only concern now was to make Kyoya a damn fine Chuunin, that and make him capable of keeping up with her in combat. Her hit and run tactics tended to make her team mates move at one speed.

Hers.

But still, given the fact he was a genin, she didn't raise her expectations all that much. He'd need some molding and after a few PT sessions with her, he'd get it fast. Looking down at Kyoya, she got a nasty smile on her face that didn't promise very good things to come. "[color=brown]In three days, you're gonna get a training session with me. fifteen hundred hours, don't be late and make sure you show up or you're gonna regret it.[/color]"

			Kyoya wouldn't feel uncomfortable when Nui pulled him closer to her, since his sister always was around him throughout his life, after listening to what she said, Kyoya closed his eyes and said, "[color=Orangered]Trust me I'm not like Mr. Showoff Loud Mouth over there, or anyone else you have in mind. You may consider me a lazy bastard since i usually never try at anything except certain things. I'm also not as fast as you most likely sensei, but I'll actually try my best to keep up.[/color]"

As Kyoya listened to Tokaido make his speech, he would say, "[color=Orangered]That sounds reasonable to say the least. You guys better cover our asses and don't miss your targets.[/color]" As Kyoya heard Nui talk about marking targets so they can be sensed easier, Kyoya thought to himself, [i][color=Orangered]'Sensed easier?' Oh crap I don't know any sensory jutsus at all.[/color][/i]

Kyoya would see Nui smile at him and responded after some thought of what she said, "[color=Orangered]I'll make it, anything i need to bring for this training by any chance sensei or do i need to bring only the essentials?[/color]" Afterwards Kyoya would think to himself, [i][color=Orangered]Man that is one creepy smile.[/color][/i]

			(OOC: Welp, I decided to color code Arsenal's quotes.)

Arsenal was secretly impressed with Madoka's transparent jutsu. It simply looked cool and that was enough for the genin to like it. However, he refused to show it. He crossed his arms and swiftly turned his head while saying no. They just gathered, but some of Madoka's childish charm may have ran off on the boy. As Arsenal stood there pouting he began to think about some of Madoka's jutsu. He was a support chuunin with many abilities he never really knew about as a fresh genin, yet medical jutsu was pretty self explanatory. Arsenal was quite interested with the chuunin's medical skills.

As Nui walked to Kyoya, Arsenal did the same only to Tokaido.

[color=#9300C4]"And I guess we'll be training soon too, Testosterone-sensei?"[/color] Asked Arsenal after Nui setting her's up. He had his hand behind his head and began to smile. This was the first time the boy called Tokaido Testosterone-sensei face to face, it was time to see if he was like Nui. Regardless, he would probably never stop calling Tokaido that, at least not any time soon.

Then, Arsenal's head jerked back in confusion. He then arched his back forward a little while dramatically turning his head to Kyoya. [color=#9300C4]"Who are you, again?"[/color] He asked, tilting his head a little while scratching his chin. This genin seriously had a strange obsession with Arsenal. They just met, at least from what Arsenal could remember, and the dude kept dogging him out. It wasn't like he had a reason to do so. Arsenal never pointed the finger at him and embarrassed him as he does to--oh wait, he did. He literally did. [color=#9300C4]"Oh, Genin![/color]" He softly said as he lightly punched his palm in remembrance. His target practiced with Madoka completely lead him to forget about Genin. He was just that forgettable.

Hmmn, Arsenal gave a sudden glance back to, Madoka. Forgetting about Genin.

[color=#9300C4]"And, would you mind teaching me a little in medical ninjutsu?"[/color]

His words may have been random, but he had his reasons. He couldn't care less about medicine, but he figured he could learn quite a bit about it before he started experimenting with poisons. The boy had a strange interest in it.

After Arsenal was at his side, he took notice of Nui and the new arrival, Kyoya. The sight of her basically pressing him against her breasts started to make him visibly envious, his face contorted with a mix of anger and jealousy. He was just about to make a remark about it when he came to a sudden realization. [color=#090]"Madoka, you should probably come with us as well, so that we can strategize with your sensory style.

			Madoka snapped to attention when Nui directed a comment towards him. He gulped for dramatic emphasis, [b][color=#fff]“Yes ma’am!” [/color][/b]that would be his first order of business now that it had been commanded of him. So far Nui didn’t like him but at least she didn’t hate him either which was good news for him. For now at least.

He was surprised when Arsenal asked for his assistance. He had seemed to be the type of person he would be too proud and arrogant to ask for advice but it seemed he had found a more humble disposition to after all, at least for the moment. [b][color=#fff]“Yeah, of course!”[/color][/b] he answered, brimming with excitement at the prospect. Maybe he would even be able to befriend his new teammate. He had realized that he was the odd man out of the team but that suited him well enough. He preferred to train his own skills in private anyway but he was more than happy to pass on any of his own skills if it would benefit one of his teammates. He smiled widely when Tokaido invited him along anyway, [color=#fff][b]“Oh yeah, I’m sure there will be a few injuries then I can patch you guys up and show Arsenal the ropes” [/b][/color]he said, giving Arsenal a thumbs up, [color=#000][i]Although, I have a feeling Kyoya would need me more[/i][/color],  he realized. He didn’t envy the boy for being paired up with Nui. In fact the thought scared him so much he shivered and promptly lost control of his chakra as the last of his crows dispersed.

			Nui released Kyoya as she stepped away and appraised him. She knew the kid was gonna need everything, that and to bring his best skills with him because she didn't go easy. Anyone who's seen her 'go easy' on someone knew that it was just her stretching her muscles and getting ready for training. She was probably gonna break something on the kid in their first bout, she could already tell. After all, he was genin and with her specific style, she was gonna hit and run a lot on this kid.

"[color=brown]Everything you'd take on a mission. You're gonna fight me and we're gonna see where you are lacking. After you'd recovered, we'll attempt some proper training. I hope you have good health care, cause you're gonna wanna prepare for a hospital visit after we train.[/color]" Nui warned. With that said she began to ignore Tokaido's comments again as she started planning out what she would need to train. She had a basis for plenty of higher ranking techniques, and with some tweaking she could create a new array of hit and run techniques.

"[color=brown]Gonna need to figure out that new Taijutsu shit soon...[/color]" She mumbled to herself.

			Kyoya would nod to acknowledge Nui's requirements, he would turn to Arsenal and give him a death stare as he said, "[color=Orangered]If you listened the first time I said my name then you'd know it. I'm not repeating myself.[/color]"

Kyoya would think to himself, [i][color=Orangered]I wonder if I'll be ready in time for the cell's first mission? I don't want to be the weak link on the team.[/color][/i]

			A smile crossed Tokaido's face again, the serious business being taken care of for the time it seemed. He didn't see much point in sticking around, their business concluded. [color=#090]"Great, If all goes according to schedule we should be starting missions soon after some good training exercises and bonding with each other. with that being said, if all is taken care of, I think we're done here. Dememaru, ill see you bright and early a few days from now. Madoka, feel free to join us or Nui, we could all use a little time with you to get aquainted. And Nui, try not to break the kid, he's no good to us crippled."[/color] With that last comment, he would turn to take his leave, unless he was stopped by someone.

			[color=#9300C4][b]"Heheh,"[/b][/color] giggled Arsenal. He brought his hands down from his head and relaxed. Tokaido was okay with being call Testosterone-sensei. After hearing the time of the training the boy raised his brow. At the academy they never had to get up at five. He wanted to protest, but he was ready to go. Besides it was a couple days away. So, he keep quiet. The genin truly hoped he could learn a lot from Tokaido. With his goal to challenge the Raikage, he had to grow stronger. And to do that he had to believe in Tokaido, and the rest of the cell. He was sure they all would play a role in his development.

[color=#9300C4][b]"Yeah, Madoka,"[/b][/color] agreed Arsenal with Tokaido. [color=#9300C4][b]"Preferably us, 'cause, ya know, cough, cough, we actually have a genin with potential here."[/b][/color] He said coughing and clearing his throat at the end. Arsenal deliberately aimed that quote at Kyoya.

[color=#9300C4][b]"Welp,"[/b][/color] said Arsenal while making one loud clap. [color=#9300C4][b]"I'll be heading in. I hope my mom cooked, heheh, later."[/b][/color] He would begin to climb back up the mountain. No one stopped him or Tokaido. The meeting was done and how debatable the cell was is left up to you.

[b] Kazuki, Ryoga[/b]

The Sanguine Stalker

["They should feel privileged...in their last moments, they bleed at my feet." ]

[b]General Information[/b]
[b]Age:[/b] 28

[b]Gender:[/b] Male

[b]Height:[/b] 5’11 feet

[b]Weight:[/b] 150 pounds

[b]Hair:[/b] Ryoga’s hair is about mid back in length, an orange-red in color, and usually kept tied in a ponytail about 14 inches long. The bangs flow straight down, though not long enough to obscure his vision, only coming to about mid brow.

[b]Eyes:[/b] His eyes are a grayish blue in color, appearing very serious and sharp.

[b]Physical Features:[/b] Ryoga is a slender, toned man, showing some decent muscle growth while retaining a slim physique. He bears scars all over his body, all from fights and training exercises. His most specific scar is a claw mark going across his chest, given to him by his Toukai rival. He almost always has a straight face, even during combat, and his gaze is enough to strike fear into those who know him.

[b]Clothing/Accessories:[/b] Ryoga wears a standard Kiri sleeveless top and long pants, both black in color. Overtop of this, he wears a kimono outfit, the top being blue while the bottom is white. He wears standard ninja sandals for footwear, and his belt is a simple white cloth tied around his waist, with his sword sheath holstered on it.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] His headband is tied around his left bicep, on display.

[b]Personality:[/b] Ryoga is a man that believes power is everything. If you lack it, you are worthless, not even worth the effort of swinging his blade. He is incredibly loyal to the ideology of Kirigakure, believing that the weak should be disposed of, leaving the strong to lead. On the opposite side, anyone who proves to have power, regardless of their specialty, has Ryoga’s respect. If he hasn't met the person before, he gives them some time to prove themselves. If they fail, they don’t get a second thought.

As far as personal interest goes, Ryoga spends his time hunting ninja whenever possible. He trains every single day, for hours if he has the time to. He has little interest in romance, though he has found one or two women that he had “feelings” for. As far as friendship goes, he isn’t exactly “close” to anyone, though he is somewhat friendly to a few people, and he can work with others should the need arise. Ryoga treats everything seriously, almost oblivious to sarcasm or jokes. His seriousness, combined with his mentality, makes him an iconic display of Kirigakure’s might.

[b]Strength:[/b] 5
[b]Speed:[/b] 8
[b]Wit: [/b] 7

[b]Equipment:[/b]

Ryoga carries a specially crafted Katana with him on his left hip. The blade is about 24 inches in length, while the hilt is 12 inches long, making the weapon 3 feet altogether. Right above the hilt, on the back end of the blade, is a sharpened edge for Ryoga to slit his finger on, allowing his blood to flow into small crevices laced throughout the weapon’s blade. This is for allowing his blood to enter an opponent’s bloodstream, to use specific Chiton techniques afterwards.

[b]Combat Style:[/b] Ryoga uses his sword as a means of infecting his enemies body with his blood, then utilizing Chiton jutsu to use it as an internal weapon. He can just as easily take someones head off with his sword however, as he is an incredible swordsmen. He relies on his speed as a means of closing the gap, as he only has a few ranged options.

[quote]
Iaido:Iaido Kenjutsu is a sword style originating from the Land of Tea that focuses on the fact that when first drawn, the linear motion and force of pulling a katana from its sheath are able to generate unusually fast slashes. Iaido capitalizes on this, it's samurai equally skilled in close range hand-to-hand fighting and then being able to switch to single fast slashes and stabs before returning to previous combat, making them unpredictable fighters.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b] 2/3

Sensor

Sensors are people that are able to sense chakra and locate it. This can be done in a number of ways, but most often in the form of some sort of environmental empathy with the elements. Masters of these techniques are usually built around support or subterfuge, but usually both. Because the source of a ninja’s power is chakra, those that are able to detect it with any kind of accuracy are able to access tactical options that other ninja are incapable of.

Chiton

By being a master of Suiton and using the secrets of Kirigakure no Sato, the user is able to use the next step of the Suiton element, Chiton. Chiton is the elemental release that is able to manipulate the user's blood for their jutsu, while also enabling them to reproduce that blood at tremendous levels. Users of Chiton can manipulate other people's blood, as long as it's outside of their bodies. Chiton's unique quality is persisting. Unlike other chakra affinities, Chiton techniques can last for a longer duration.

[b]Jutsu:[/b]
SuitonShow [color=dodgerblue][b]*Water Purifier[/b][/color]

D-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Minimum Control Stat of 5

After forming the needed hand seals, the user touches a body of water. Then, the water becomes purified of germs, bacteria, disease and other organic materials. In addition, the water becomes 'pure' which can be used for many different things. However, this does not eliminate foreign chakra from the water. This technique can purify up to five gallons of water per post, and can be used for every point of stamina the user has, meaning that the user may simply purify five gallons in one post, ten gallons in two and so forth. While using this technique, the user must be constantly touching the water and cannot use any other techniques.

[b]History[/b]

Ryoga was born as an only child on a moonlit night in Kirigakure. Both of his parents were incredible Jounin, his mother a master of Iijutsu and his father an expert of Iaido style. Ryoga was raised in an odd way compared to most, there was no affection between him and his parents, though the boy did respect them and care for them, and his parents loved him greatly. He was raised to be a ninja, being taught the way of Iaido by his father, while not really gathering much from his mother, though he did learn a deal about human anatomy from her. He was enrolled in the academy at the age of 10 by his father.

His academy years were the days that Ryoga truly found himself. While his first year wasn’t much outside of rigorous training, after he was put on a team during his second year and the fighting began, he proved to be one of the most adept swordsmen in the academy. Near the end of his second year, he slashed a student’s artery by “accident”, killing the boy within a minute. Ryoga argued it was the students fault for dropping his guard, and he felt no pity for the weak boy. The teachers looked oddly at this, though he was not penalized for it. He also discovered his affinity for Suiton jutsu during his academy years, proving to be decent with basic Suiton techniques. During the last half of his final year, he was always supervised while fighting or training to prevent any more deaths. He graduated at the top of his class with most of his class’s respect and fear.

As a genin, Ryoga began truly learning the Iaido techniques his father learned as a kid. He also learned Suiton techniques from his mother. His partner during his genin days, a Toukai, proved to be an equal match for him in skill, and gave him some of his first real scars during their sparring matches. This would be the first person Ryoga really respected as an equal rival. His ability with Ninjutsu and his speed with a blade would compete against his claws and chakra vent speed almost everyday, each one learning from the other through their spars and occasional training. On missions, they were very competitive, each one using every advantage they could get on the other to do the job the best. When he turned 17, Ryoga and his rival entered the chuunin exams together, and their familiarity with each other and incredible speed ended up catching the chuunin off guard, bringing him to his knees within a few minutes. They graduated to chuunin rank, and talked very little afterwards, having gained everything they needed from each other.

Ryoga’s chuunin years were some of his favorite times. He began to come into his own with the Kenjutsu he learned from his father, his speed proving to be his greatest strength. He also began his research into the art of chiton jutsu. The idea of using blood fascinated Ryoga, using someone’s lifesource as a weapon was an incredible power, and he wanted it. So after much practice, research, and training, he managed to teach himself some basic chiton techniques by the age of 19. It felt incredible to be able to manifest his blood in such ways, and he became almost obsessed with blood. His missions normally had messy results if they involved combat, as he normally slashed his victims throat or midsection in a few swipes. He realized the potential of using someone’s blood as a tracking source, and at the age of 22 Ranked to a Special Jounin who specialized in Tracking and Execution.

As a Special Jounin, Ryoga took every opportunity he could to hunt Missing Ninja of Kiri. He felt that their continued presence was a blemish on Kiri’s image, and that he was doing Kirigakure a service by hunting the runaway dogs of the village. Because of his methods of Chiton empathy sensing and blood tracking, He earned the title “Sanguine Stalker”. When he was 24 years old, he had his custom made Katana forged, with Grooves in the blade and a sharpened edge near the hilt, where the thumb rests. Ryoga would begin crafting ways to use his blood as a catalyst in his opponents body, using his sword as a method of transfer. Ryoga decided to rank up to jounin at the age of 25, after garnering a rack of 10 Missing Ninja kills.

When he became a Jounin, the idea to join the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist dawned on him. They were truly on his level, and he could be considered their equal with a bit more training. He began hammering into his Kenjutsu training, taking it to all new heights, and training for hours a day everyday if possible. His only aim at this point is training and proving himself to Kiri so that he might be recognized by the Seven Swordsmen as a brother.

The Sanguine Stalker

["They should feel privileged...in their last moments, they bleed at my feet." ]

[b]General Information[/b]
[b]Age:[/b] 28

[b]Gender:[/b] Male

[b]Height:[/b] 5’11 feet

[b]Weight:[/b] 150 pounds

[b]Hair:[/b] Ryoga’s hair is about mid back in length, an orange-red in color, and usually kept tied in a ponytail about 14 inches long. The bangs flow straight down, though not long enough to obscure his vision, only coming to about mid brow.

[b]Eyes:[/b] His eyes are a grayish blue in color, appearing very serious and sharp.

[b]Physical Features:[/b] Ryoga is a slender, toned man, showing some decent muscle growth while retaining a slim physique. He bears scars all over his body, all from fights and training exercises. His most specific scar is a claw mark going across his chest, given to him by his Toukai rival. He almost always has a straight face, even during combat, and his gaze is enough to strike fear into those who know him.

[b]Clothing/Accessories:[/b] Ryoga wears a standard Kiri sleeveless top and long pants, both black in color. Overtop of this, he wears a kimono outfit, the top being blue while the bottom is white. He wears standard ninja sandals for footwear, and his belt is a simple white cloth tied around his waist, with his sword sheath holstered on it.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] His headband is tied around his left bicep, on display.

[b]Personality:[/b] Ryoga is a man that believes power is everything. If you lack it, you are worthless, not even worth the effort of swinging his blade. He is incredibly loyal to the ideology of Kirigakure, believing that the weak should be disposed of, leaving the strong to lead. On the opposite side, anyone who proves to have power, regardless of their specialty, has Ryoga’s respect. If he hasn't met the person before, he gives them some time to prove themselves. If they fail, they don’t get a second thought.

As far as personal interest goes, Ryoga spends his time hunting ninja whenever possible. He trains every single day, for hours if he has the time to. He has little interest in romance, though he has found one or two women that he had “feelings” for. As far as friendship goes, he isn’t exactly “close” to anyone, though he is somewhat friendly to a few people, and he can work with others should the need arise. Ryoga treats everything seriously, almost oblivious to sarcasm or jokes. His seriousness, combined with his mentality, makes him an iconic display of Kirigakure’s might.

[b]Equipment:[/b]

Ryoga carries a specially crafted Katana with him on his left hip. The blade is about 24 inches in length, while the hilt is 12 inches long, making the weapon 3 feet altogether. Right above the hilt, on the back end of the blade, is a sharpened edge for Ryoga to slit his finger on, allowing his blood to flow into small crevices laced throughout the weapon’s blade. This is for allowing his blood to enter an opponent’s bloodstream, to use specific Chiton techniques afterwards.

[b]Combat Style:[/b] Ryoga uses his sword as a means of infecting his enemies body with his blood, then utilizing Chiton jutsu to use it as an internal weapon. He can just as easily take someones head off with his sword however, as he is an incredible swordsmen. He relies on his speed as a means of closing the gap, as he only has a few ranged options.

[quote]
Iaido:Iaido Kenjutsu is a sword style originating from the Land of Tea that focuses on the fact that when first drawn, the linear motion and force of pulling a katana from its sheath are able to generate unusually fast slashes. Iaido capitalizes on this, it's samurai equally skilled in close range hand-to-hand fighting and then being able to switch to single fast slashes and stabs before returning to previous combat, making them unpredictable fighters.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b] 2/3

Sensor

Sensors are people that are able to sense chakra and locate it. This can be done in a number of ways, but most often in the form of some sort of environmental empathy with the elements. Masters of these techniques are usually built around support or subterfuge, but usually both. Because the source of a ninja’s power is chakra, those that are able to detect it with any kind of accuracy are able to access tactical options that other ninja are incapable of.

Chiton

By being a master of Suiton and using the secrets of Kirigakure no Sato, the user is able to use the next step of the Suiton element, Chiton. Chiton is the elemental release that is able to manipulate the user's blood for their jutsu, while also enabling them to reproduce that blood at tremendous levels. Users of Chiton can manipulate other people's blood, as long as it's outside of their bodies. Chiton's unique quality is persisting. Unlike other chakra affinities, Chiton techniques can last for a longer duration.

This works with blunted side of a sword, but it can also draw out their strength and the blade's cutting power in full to quickly slash apart obstacles. Re-sheathing after this technique may take a bit longer; the placement of the hands following this technqiue make it difficult to resheath properly.

[b]History[/b]

Ryoga was born as an only child on a moonlit night in Kirigakure. Both of his parents were incredible Jounin, his mother a master of Iijutsu and his father an expert of Iaido style. Ryoga was raised in an odd way compared to most, there was no affection between him and his parents, though the boy did respect them and care for them, and his parents loved him greatly. He was raised to be a ninja, being taught the way of Iaido by his father, while not really gathering much from his mother, though he did learn a deal about human anatomy from her. He was enrolled in the academy at the age of 10 by his father.

His academy years were the days that Ryoga truly found himself. While his first year wasn’t much outside of rigorous training, after he was put on a team during his second year and the fighting began, he proved to be one of the most adept swordsmen in the academy. Near the end of his second year, he slashed a student’s artery by “accident”, killing the boy within a minute. Ryoga argued it was the students fault for dropping his guard, and he felt no pity for the weak boy. The teachers looked oddly at this, though he was not penalized for it. He also discovered his affinity for Suiton jutsu during his academy years, proving to be decent with basic Suiton techniques. During the last half of his final year, he was always supervised while fighting or training to prevent any more deaths. He graduated at the top of his class with most of his class’s respect and fear.

As a genin, Ryoga began truly learning the Iaido techniques his father learned as a kid. He also learned Suiton techniques from his mother. His partner during his genin days, a Toukai, proved to be an equal match for him in skill, and gave him some of his first real scars during their sparring matches. This would be the first person Ryoga really respected as an equal rival. His ability with Ninjutsu and his speed with a blade would compete against his claws and chakra vent speed almost everyday, each one learning from the other through their spars and occasional training. On missions, they were very competitive, each one using every advantage they could get on the other to do the job the best. When he turned 17, Ryoga and his rival entered the chuunin exams together, and their familiarity with each other and incredible speed ended up catching the chuunin off guard, bringing him to his knees within a few minutes. They graduated to chuunin rank, and talked very little afterwards, having gained everything they needed from each other.

Ryoga’s chuunin years were some of his favorite times. He began to come into his own with the Kenjutsu he learned from his father, his speed proving to be his greatest strength. He also began his research into the art of chiton jutsu. The idea of using blood fascinated Ryoga, using someone’s lifesource as a weapon was an incredible power, and he wanted it. So after much practice, research, and training, he managed to teach himself some basic chiton techniques by the age of 19. It felt incredible to be able to manifest his blood in such ways, and he became almost obsessed with blood. His missions normally had messy results if they involved combat, as he normally slashed his victims throat or midsection in a few swipes. He realized the potential of using someone’s blood as a tracking source, and at the age of 22 Ranked to a Special Jounin who specialized in Tracking and Execution.

As a Special Jounin, Ryoga took every opportunity he could to hunt Missing Ninja of Kiri. He felt that their continued presence was a blemish on Kiri’s image, and that he was doing Kirigakure a service by hunting the runaway dogs of the village. Because of his methods of Chiton empathy sensing and blood tracking, He earned the title “Sanguine Stalker”. When he was 24 years old, he had his custom made Katana forged, with Grooves in the blade and a sharpened edge near the hilt, where the thumb rests. Ryoga would begin crafting ways to use his blood as a catalyst in his opponents body, using his sword as a method of transfer. Ryoga decided to rank up to jounin at the age of 25, after garnering a rack of 10 Missing Ninja kills.

When he became a Jounin, the idea to join the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist dawned on him. They were truly on his level, and he could be considered their equal with a bit more training. He began hammering into his Kenjutsu training, taking it to all new heights, and training for hours a day everyday if possible. His only aim at this point is training and proving himself to Kiri so that he might be recognized by the Seven Swordsmen as a brother.

The Sanguine Stalker

["They should feel privileged...in their last moments, they bleed at my feet." ]

[b]General Information[/b]
[b]Age:[/b] 28

[b]Gender:[/b] Male

[b]Height:[/b] 5’11 feet

[b]Weight:[/b] 150 pounds

[b]Hair:[/b] Ryoga’s hair is about mid back in length, an orange-red in color, and usually kept tied in a ponytail about 14 inches long. The bangs flow straight down, though not long enough to obscure his vision, only coming to about mid brow.

[b]Eyes:[/b] His eyes are a grayish blue in color, appearing very serious and sharp.

[b]Physical Features:[/b] Ryoga is a slender, toned man, showing some decent muscle growth while retaining a slim physique. He bears scars all over his body, all from fights and training exercises. His most specific scar is a claw mark going across his chest, given to him by his Toukai rival. He almost always has a straight face, even during combat, and his gaze is enough to strike fear into those who know him.

[b]Clothing/Accessories:[/b] Ryoga wears a standard Kiri sleeveless top and long pants, both black in color. Overtop of this, he wears a kimono outfit, the top being blue while the bottom is white. He wears standard ninja sandals for footwear, and his belt is a simple white cloth tied around his waist, with his sword sheath holstered on it.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] His headband is tied around his left bicep, on display.

[b]Personality:[/b] Ryoga is a man that believes power is everything. If you lack it, you are worthless, not even worth the effort of swinging his blade. He is incredibly loyal to the ideology of Kirigakure, believing that the weak should be disposed of, leaving the strong to lead. On the opposite side, anyone who proves to have power, regardless of their specialty, has Ryoga’s respect. If he hasn't met the person before, he gives them some time to prove themselves. If they fail, they don’t get a second thought.

As far as personal interest goes, Ryoga spends his time hunting ninja whenever possible. He trains every single day, for hours if he has the time to. He has little interest in romance, though he has found one or two women that he had “feelings” for. As far as friendship goes, he isn’t exactly “close” to anyone, though he is somewhat friendly to a few people, and he can work with others should the need arise. Ryoga treats everything seriously, almost oblivious to sarcasm or jokes. His seriousness, combined with his mentality, makes him an iconic display of Kirigakure’s might.

[b]Equipment:[/b]

Ryoga carries a specially crafted Katana with him on his left hip. The blade is about 24 inches in length, while the hilt is 12 inches long, making the weapon 3 feet altogether. Right above the hilt, on the back end of the blade, is a sharpened edge for Ryoga to slit his finger on, allowing his blood to flow into small crevices laced throughout the weapon’s blade. This is for allowing his blood to enter an opponent’s bloodstream, to use specific Chiton techniques afterwards.

[b]Combat Style:[/b] Ryoga uses his sword as a means of infecting his enemies body with his blood, then utilizing Chiton jutsu to use it as an internal weapon. He can just as easily take someones head off with his sword however, as he is an incredible swordsmen. He relies on his speed as a means of closing the gap, as he only has a few ranged options.

[quote]
Iaido:Iaido Kenjutsu is a sword style originating from the Land of Tea that focuses on the fact that when first drawn, the linear motion and force of pulling a katana from its sheath are able to generate unusually fast slashes. Iaido capitalizes on this, it's samurai equally skilled in close range hand-to-hand fighting and then being able to switch to single fast slashes and stabs before returning to previous combat, making them unpredictable fighters.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b] 2/3

Sensor

Sensors are people that are able to sense chakra and locate it. This can be done in a number of ways, but most often in the form of some sort of environmental empathy with the elements. Masters of these techniques are usually built around support or subterfuge, but usually both. Because the source of a ninja’s power is chakra, those that are able to detect it with any kind of accuracy are able to access tactical options that other ninja are incapable of.

Chiton

By being a master of Suiton and using the secrets of Kirigakure no Sato, the user is able to use the next step of the Suiton element, Chiton. Chiton is the elemental release that is able to manipulate the user's blood for their jutsu, while also enabling them to reproduce that blood at tremendous levels. Users of Chiton can manipulate other people's blood, as long as it's outside of their bodies. Chiton's unique quality is persisting. Unlike other chakra affinities, Chiton techniques can last for a longer duration.

[b]Jutsu:[/b]
SuitonShow [color=dodgerblue][b]*Water Purifier[/b][/color]

D-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Minimum Control Stat of 5

After forming the needed hand seals, the user touches a body of water. Then, the water becomes purified of germs, bacteria, disease and other organic materials. In addition, the water becomes 'pure' which can be used for many different things. However, this does not eliminate foreign chakra from the water. This technique can purify up to five gallons of water per post, and can be used for every point of stamina the user has, meaning that the user may simply purify five gallons in one post, ten gallons in two and so forth. While using this technique, the user must be constantly touching the water and cannot use any other techniques.

[color=dodgerblue][b]*Vision Modifier[/b][/color]

D-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Meant as a supplementary technique, the user will use water as a medium to enhance their vision. After performing the needed seals, the user will create a circular shape with their hand. They will then generate chakra to create a film of water that expands in the void created by their hands and will increase the distance one can see comfortably, depending on the user’s control stat. The user is also able to use this as a magnifying lens, in the sense that they are able to adjust the distance to meet their wanted field of vision. This technique lasts for three posts before dissipating.
 Control Stat – 1 to 2 – Able to see distances up to thirty feet as if they were at twenty feet.
 Control Stat – 3 to 4 – Able to see distances up to one hundred feet as if they were at twenty feet.
 Control Stat – 5 to 6 – Able to see distances up to two hundred feet as if they were at twenty feet.
 Control Stat – 7+ – Able to see distances up to five hundred feet as if they were at twenty feet.

[color=dodgerblue][b]*Slippery Catch Technique[/b][/color]

D-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

After performing a string of seals, the user will coat their body in Suiton chakra. What this technique does is give their whole body a slippery feel to it. This may aid in escaping binds, grappling techniques and may even deflect weak physical blows. This technique lasts for three posts and can only affect the user.

[color=dodgerblue][b]*Water Clone Technique[/b][/color]

C-ranked Suiton Ninjutsu

After performing the required seals, the user will be able to create clones made of water. Unlike a normal clone, the water clone has the ability to interact more with the environment due to it having physical substance. This allows the clone to carry out limited attacks on its target. The range of the clone is limited, only able to travel about fifty meters from the user. The user distributes a sufficient amount of chakra equally amongst their other clones, allowing them to use any C or D-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu the user knows.
Taijutsu – 1
Stamina – 3
Strength – 1
Speed – 3

[color=dodgerblue][b]*Guardian Fountain[/b][/color]

C-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Control Stat of 6

Requiring a slightly above average level of control, this technique generates a large amount of water as a defense mechanism. By performing a string of seals, the user will stomp and create a fountain of water from the ground that flows at a speed of five. The fountain is three meters in diameter and four meters in height. This technique lasts for three posts. All in all, this creates just over eight thousand cubic meters of water.

[color=dodgerblue][b]*Water Prison[/b][/color]

B-Rank Suiton Ninjutsu

By forming a string of seals, the user is able to spew a large ball of water that stands at three meters in diameter. This ball rolls at the target at a speed of seven. Should this strike a target, they will become engulfed within the sphere. However, if this manages to strike multiple targets, it will envelop them as well, up to a total of three prisoners. One can resist being pulled into the ball if they have a strength of seven or higher. The ball will roll thirty meters, regardless of whether or not anyone has been captured. Once inside, the targets will spin with the sphere and may cause dizziness, nausea and disorientation. The technique lasts for a total of five posts, rolling included, before bursting.

Iaido StyleShow *[color=#8B658B][b]Iaido • Swift Draw[/b][/color]

D-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 5 Taijutsu, 4 Speed

With the most widely recognized attack of Iaido style, the user draws their katana at a very quick speed, making a powerful slash in tangent with the draw.

D-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 4 Speed

*[color=#8B658B][b]Iaido • Double Back Draw[/b][/color]

C-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 6 Speed

The technique realizes the concept of a draw's momentum increasing attack speed rather than the technique of drawing itself. With this concept, the user draws their weapon and then makes an upwards slash followed by a second downward slash, and then an immediate re-sheath. This causes two deep diagonal cuts in the direction of the draw and re-sheath that happen near instantaneously.

*[color=#8B658B][b]Iaido • Beheading Draw[/b][/color]

C-Rank Kenjutsu

Prerequisite: 6 Speed

The user draws their katana with one hand and slams their palm into the back of their blade to increase the force behind the swing made in any direction.

He was raised to be a ninja, being taught the way of Iaido by his father, while not really gathering much from his mother, though he did learn a deal about human anatomy from her. He was enrolled in the academy at the age of 10 by his father.

His academy years were the days that Ryoga truly found himself. While his first year wasn’t much outside of rigorous training, after he was put on a team during his second year and the fighting began, he proved to be one of the most adept swordsmen in the academy. Near the end of his second year, he slashed a student’s artery by “accident”, killing the boy within a minute. Ryoga argued it was the students fault for dropping his guard, and he felt no pity for the weak boy. The teachers looked oddly at this, though he was not penalized for it. He also discovered his affinity for Suiton jutsu during his academy years, proving to be decent with basic Suiton techniques. During the last half of his final year, he was always supervised while fighting or training to prevent any more deaths. He graduated at the top of his class with most of his class’s respect and fear.

As a genin, Ryoga began truly learning the Iaido techniques his father learned as a kid. He also learned Suiton techniques from his mother. His partner during his genin days, a Toukai, proved to be an equal match for him in skill, and gave him some of his first real scars during their sparring matches. This would be the first person Ryoga really respected as an equal rival. His ability with Ninjutsu and his speed with a blade would compete against his claws and chakra vent speed almost everyday, each one learning from the other through their spars and occasional training. On missions, they were very competitive, each one using every advantage they could get on the other to do the job the best. When he turned 17, Ryoga and his rival entered the chuunin exams together, and their familiarity with each other and incredible speed ended up catching the chuunin off guard, bringing him to his knees within a few minutes. They graduated to chuunin rank, and talked very little afterwards, having gained everything they needed from each other.

Ryoga’s chuunin years were some of his favorite times. He began to come into his own with the Kenjutsu he learned from his father, his speed proving to be his greatest strength. He also began his research into the art of chiton jutsu. The idea of using blood fascinated Ryoga, using someone’s lifesource as a weapon was an incredible power, and he wanted it. So after much practice, research, and training, he managed to teach himself some basic chiton techniques by the age of 19. It felt incredible to be able to manifest his blood in such ways, and he became almost obsessed with blood. His missions normally had messy results if they involved combat, as he normally slashed his victims throat or midsection in a few swipes. He realized the potential of using someone’s blood as a tracking source, and at the age of 22 Ranked to a Special Jounin who specialized in Tracking and Execution.

As a Special Jounin, Ryoga took every opportunity he could to hunt Missing Ninja of Kiri. He felt that their continued presence was a blemish on Kiri’s image, and that he was doing Kirigakure a service by hunting the runaway dogs of the village. Because of his methods of Chiton empathy sensing and blood tracking, He earned the title “Sanguine Stalker”. When he was 24 years old, he had his custom made Katana forged, with Grooves in the blade and a sharpened edge near the hilt, where the thumb rests. Ryoga would begin crafting ways to use his blood as a catalyst in his opponents body, using his sword as a method of transfer. Ryoga decided to rank up to jounin at the age of 25, after garnering a rack of 10 Missing Ninja kills.

When he became a Jounin, the idea to join the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist dawned on him. They were truly on his level, and he could be considered their equal with a bit more training. He began hammering into his Kenjutsu training, taking it to all new heights, and training for hours a day everyday if possible. His only aim at this point is training and proving himself to Kiri so that he might be recognized by the Seven Swordsmen as a brother.

			Alright, nice looking app.

Just a few things to point out:

Eyes: His eyes are a hazel blue in color- Hazel blue eyes? those are two distinctly different colors, just stick to saying grayish blue.

Physical features seems a little short, especially because you don't include a picture. Maybe go into more detail about the other scars and where they're located. Also, I know eye scars are cool and all but how would something like that not damage the eye itself?

Personality: He comes across as quite the loner, how does he respond to working with others?

Equipment: Are you sure you don't want anything else? You don't have anything in the way of ranged weaponry or explosives, smoke grenades etc..

For combat style, write a description of how he uses his various techniques together rather than just the description of one aspect of his arsenal.

Put in the 2/3 under the abilities section

Jutsu looks good, so does history though a Kiri OOC will have to approve it. One thing though: "Ryoga decided to rank up to jounin at the age of 25" - Pretty sure Kiri ninja don't get to choose when they are promoted but again the history is Kiri OOC jurisdiction and not mine.

Overall though very concise and well done, shouldn't take long to get accepted!

			Okay: Changed the eyes to grayish blue, changed his scar to a claw mark across his chest, Found a picture that fits him, Added that he isn't objective to working with a team should it be required, added what he intends to do with his weapon (though he doesn't have the jutsu learned yet), and fixed the abilities thing.

I don't really want anything other then my sword, he isn't exactly that kind of ninja. I envisioned him more as a samurai kind of character, but since i'm shooting for SSM he is still a ninja, so i had to combine the two into a ninja who only uses a sword and his jutsu. worse comes to worse i can get some later if i feel under equipped, but thanks for caring enough to bring it up. XD

			That picture is clearly Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin; possible even older than that dating to Samurai X. You'll have to remove the picture please.

			Power doesn't necessarily mean "strength". power is having the ability to take what comes your way and deal with it in your own way, be it strength, speed, ninjutsu, or whatever you decide to use. i can quote the kenjutsu no problem, and for the blood all i'd have to do is put them in airtight containers right? besides, its not like i couldn't just constantly refill them with fresh blood every now and then.

EDIT: I removed them anyway, i'll just resort to using only what i have at my disposal.

			The only thing I see wrong is your Chiton pyramid.

Right now you have

  DDD

CCCCC

  BBB

To have five C's you need six D's

Other than that everything looks good as far as I'm concerned

			Your chiton empathy and your chiton would technically count into the same pyramid. But are house in separate pyramids, it's a bit confusing that way but its how it goes. The empathy sensory pyramid starts at C-Rank sure, but you still need supporting chiton D-Ranks to support it.

			so its basically a pyramid within a pyramid? thats not inception or anything T.T ill fix it, and edit this post when its done. probably be up by tomorrow.

EDIT: Okay, so i removed Scent of Prey and Snap Draw from Iaido style, and added 2 custom Chiton techniques. my current Iaido pyramid is a bit odd, but it technically falls within the boundaries of a pyramid i think. besides, im gonna train it to be a full A rank pyramid eventually. so as long as everything is okay, this should be everything.

			So what im trying to do is invent a way to use blood as a catalyst for empathy sensor jutsu. i made a basic 5 jutsu pyramid, but i've never made sensory techs before, so some constructive criticism would be great =)

Chiton EmpathyShow [b][color=#DC143C]Blood Trail[/color][/b]

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Control 6

After doing the needed hand seals, the user channels chiton chakra into at least a pint of someone's blood, and attempts to locate the target at a speed equal to the user's control. If the target is within 30 yards of the user, the user can sense the direction, distance and location of the targets blood.

[b][color=#DC143c]Feel the Pulse[/color][/b]

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Control 6

After doing the needed hand seals, the user channels their chakra into the surrounding area, travelling at a speed equal to the user's control, up to 30 yards away. This allows the user to sense nearby blood pulses. At this level, it doesn't allow for pinpoint movements, but it does allow for the user to sense direction and distance.

[b][color=#DC143c]Singled Out[/color][/b]

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: [b][color=#DC143C]Feel the Pulse[/color][/b], control 6

After sensing someone through Feel the Pulse and adding a few additional hand seals, the user can focus in on a specific person's blood signature. The user hones in on this specific signature if it is within a 30 yard range, and begins to track it down.

B-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: Control 8, [b][color=#DC143C]Blood Trail[/color][/b]

After doing the needed hand seals, the user channels chiton chakra into at least a pint of someone's blood, and attempts to locate the target at a speed equal to the user's control. If the target is within 60 yards of the user, the user can sense the direction, distance, and location of the target's blood.

			Just a simple thing first, remove the gaps between each jutsu and add a bold code to the name of the jutsu and any prerequisite jutsu should be in colour also.

[b][color=#DC143C] Hemopulse [/color][/b]

B-Ranked Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: [b][color=#DC143C]Feel the Pulse [/color][/b],Control 8

After doing the needed hand seals, the user channels their chakra into the surrounding area, travelling at a speed equal to the user's control, up to 60 yards away. This allows the user to sense nearby blood pulses. At this level, it doesn't allow for pinpoint movements, but it does allow for the user to sense direction and distance.

I have a small issue with bloodtype Analyzation in all this jutsu sounds fine, but I don’t know why you’d need to know unless it’s for medical purposes. But it’s not required on our apps to add the bloodtype and would rely on asking the person you are targeting breaking up roleplay.  May I suggest Blood Scent should have a prerequisite of Blood Trail as this is an advanced form.  Other than that I like them, though I’m not sure if it would require they require a Sensor ability.

			so i fixed the fonts for you, and went ahead and added the prereqs. as for the Bloodtype thing, it was more of a way to specifically target one person, so as to single them out by bloodtype. i can try and switch it to something else, but basically the pulses are a sonar-esque ability, and the analyzation is meant to single in on a person within range.

			Don't forget to remove the gaps between each line, like on the example I gave.

And for the bloodtype thing, I understand what your saying. But what if two or three people had the same bloodtype surly that wouldn't distinguish them and you wouldn't know who is who. Perhaps rather than working out the exact blood type, it could just simply distinguish an individuals blood that would make more sense to me.

			Okay, removed the gaps and removed the bloodtype thing. changed it into a different technique, thats similar but not reliant on a bloodtype or anything.

			Blood trail has no previous jutsu to be used, and requires a pint of someones blood to be used as a catalyst for the tracking, but because of this, its more reliable to use if you have the blood available. Singled out is meant to be used in tandem with Feel the pulse or a similar ability, and is basically a method of ignoring the vast amount of blood signatures in favor of focusing in and tracking a specific person down.

			Very amusing read, I have to admit.  I'm gonna say a 4 to Tse, and a 3 to Ty.  While a great interaction, for the first half Tse had the better posts, though Ty you did catch up at the end.

			The sound of metal rings sliding across a metal bar as someone yanked open curtains made the noise feel like a blast of agony that just pounded upon the ear drums of a hung over member of the Ishiguro clan. She groaned and curled up in her bed as she slung curses at the fool stupid enough to wake her from her victory slumber. A soft tap and a few quiet rattles made her pry open one eye to see a glass of water and a few pills on her night stand. The soft chuckle of a familiar voice made her grumble something incoherently as her youngest older brother left the room, closing the door so it was ajar enough for the smell of food to flood into her room.

A hand blindly reached out and grabbed the pills before she put them in her mouth and dry swallowed, having practiced this for months just to keep from having to sit up in bed after a hard night of drinking. And of course, Jin would try drawing her from her sheets with the smell of food. Nui was a bizarre person like that, she was always hungry when she was hungover. Slipping out of bed, the woman opened the door and left her room as she made her way toward the kitchen nook of her apartment.

"Oh come on! At least put clothes on!" Jin protested as Nui gave him the finger. "[color=brown]You're in my house, so I can dress as I please.[/color]" Nui responded as she had made it a well known fact to her family that in her home she was 'king'. They'd protest but ultimately they would shut up since it was her house rules. At least she was wearing her under garments however Jin had a way to fix this, "Put some clothes on or I scrap breakfast."

Nui wanted to glare at him but that required opening her eyes. As she worked her way back toward her bedroom she called him a something that rhymed with itch mass s'more while beginning her search for clothes. As she returned with a fresh set of clothing on, Jin place a plate on the table and a glass of water. Nui wanted OJ but she knew she needed the water just a little bit more. "[color=brown]Th'nks[/color]" She mumbled as she started to eat.

"By the way, while you were snoring the morning away, a messenger popped by. Believe it or not they're trying to put you back on a genin team to help train them. Your new 'partner' will be by a little later to discuss things. Try to be sober... and showered." Jin said as he started washing dishes. Nui finished chewing only to swallow her food and open her mouth, "[color=brown]Yes mom.[/color]" She drawled half heartedly.

Jin finished washing before long and ruffled Nui's still messy bed hair, "Be good, it's your first day with a new partner so don't kill him just yet." "[color=brown]I make no promises.[/color]" Nui responded, more coherent now than she was. The food was doing well in starting up her system and the water was gonna help flush her out, but mostly it was the aspirin kicking in and dulling all that hangover crap.

And with that she wanted a shower. Standing up and leaving the plate on the table she removed all her clothing and wandered toward the bathroom.

			The sound of metal rings sliding across a metal bar as someone yanked open curtains made the noise feel like a blast of agony that just pounded upon the ear drums of a hung over member of the Ishiguro clan. She groaned and curled up in her bed as she slung curses at the fool stupid enough to wake her from her victory slumber. A soft tap and a few quiet rattles made her pry open one eye to see a glass of water and a few pills on her night stand. The soft chuckle of a familiar voice made her grumble something incoherently as her youngest older brother left the room, closing the door so it was ajar enough for the smell of food to flood into her room.

A hand blindly reached out and grabbed the pills before she put them in her mouth and dry swallowed, having practiced this for months just to keep from having to sit up in bed after a hard night of drinking. And of course, Jin would try drawing her from her sheets with the smell of food. Nui was a bizarre person like that, she was always hungry when she was hungover. Slipping out of bed, the woman opened the door and left her room as she made her way toward the kitchen nook of her apartment.

"Oh come on! At least put clothes on!" Jin protested as Nui gave him the finger. "[color=brown]You're in my house, so I can dress as I please.[/color]" Nui responded as she had made it a well known fact to her family that in her home she was 'king'. They'd protest but ultimately they would shut up since it was her house rules. At least she was wearing her under garments however Jin had a way to fix this, "Put some clothes on or I scrap breakfast."

Nui wanted to glare at him but that required opening her eyes. As she worked her way back toward her bedroom she called him a something that rhymed with itch mass s'more while beginning her search for clothes. As she returned with a fresh set of clothing on, Jin place a plate on the table and a glass of water. Nui wanted OJ but she knew she needed the water just a little bit more. "[color=brown]Th'nks[/color]" She mumbled as she started to eat.

"By the way, while you were snoring the morning away, a messenger popped by. Believe it or not they're trying to put you back on a genin team to help train them. Your new 'partner' will be by a little later to discuss things. Try to be sober... and showered." Jin said as he started washing dishes. Nui finished chewing only to swallow her food and open her mouth, "[color=brown]Yes mom.[/color]" She drawled half heartedly.

Jin finished washing before long and ruffled Nui's still messy bed hair, "Be good, it's your first day with a new partner so don't kill him just yet." "[color=brown]I make no promises.[/color]" Nui responded, more coherent now than she was. The food was doing well in starting up her system and the water was gonna help flush her out, but mostly it was the aspirin kicking in and dulling all that hangover crap.

And with that she wanted a shower. Standing up and leaving the plate on the table she removed all her clothing and wandered toward the bathroom.

			[color=#090]"[i]ahhh... i love this village!"[/i][/color] Tokaido thought to himself as he walked through Kumo, happy as he could be due to the amount of good looking women currently walking the street. As he walked, a few caught him staring more than once and shot a smile in his direction. He would've stopped and "conversed" with them, but unfortunately he had places to be. specifically, he was going to meet a partner for training a genin team. He didn't particularly want to train the youngsters, but he had been there before, and knew that everyone needed someone to look up to, and in his eyes he was quite the role model.

After a good while of walking through the village, Tokaido finally arrived at his destination: an apartment complex, full of apartments. [color=#090]"Damnit, they would have to live in an apartment complex... good thing i have the address."[/color] he said aloud as he read the address off the paper. He had been given no prior information about his partner, and had no idea who they were. He was simply told by a messenger that he was being "called to train a Genin team with a partner who had "bad" history with training them, and required a partner to keep them in check" and given the address and a time to show up. he was a bit early, but he figured his partner would be up and presentable at this hour.

after spending some time going through the complex, he finally arrived at his partner's apartment. Tokaido did a once-over on his appearance, making sure his mission outfit looked nice and tidy to make that good first impression. His black vest, red pants, boots and pouches looked alright enough, and his hair was in its usual ponytail with the part down the middle. after confirming all of this, He proceeded to knock on the door and wait patiently for someone to answer.

			Nui had gotten the water to a temperature she always used and was standing under the down pour of warmth that cascaded over her body. She had quickly scrubbed herself down with soap and had just finished rinsing the various products out of her hair, getting them out of the way so she could just soak for a bit. It was relaxing to say the least and as she tilted her head back within the stream of droplets that rained down on her she sighed at the relaxation. It was then that some damned fool knocked on her door.

Her eyes opened as she righted her head, her hand reaching for the handle that controlled the flow of water. The water ceased and silence echoed through the bathroom as she waited. Sure enough there was another knock before long and she narrowed her sharp eyes with distaste at the person who was interrupting her alone time. She pulled open the sliding door of her shower and grabbed the first towel on the rack, drying herself off at a hurried pace before wrapping it around her torso.

She trod through her apartment and made a bee line for the door and yanked it open. "[color=brown]You'd better have a good reason for interrupting my shower.[/color]" She threatened while standing there in nothing more than the towel wrapped around her body. The Ishiguro's timberwolf gray hair was still wet and hung loose, clinging to her neck as she glared at the dark haired, green eyed man at her door.

			Tokaido stood before an incredibly gorgeous woman, clad in nothing but a towel, with long gray hair dripping to the side. [color=#090]"Man oh man, it must be my birthday.

Tokaido stood before an incredibly gorgeous woman, clad in nothing but a towel, with long gray hair dripping to the side. [color=#090]"Man oh man, it must be my birthday. I dont know who you are but i'd love to find out."[/color] Tokaido said in his usual charming tone. This woman was way above average in his book. Great bust, Luscious hips, and the "get the hell away from me" attitude only served to increase his interest. But her most captivating feature, her eyes, totally caught him off guard.

			'[i][color=brown]You're so lucky there is no room for me to build up momentum in here you fucker.[/color][/i]' Nui thought to herself as the guy ogled her rather openly. She was about to slap him in the side of his head to fix where he was looking when he stared into her eyes. He had saved her the trouble of fixing where he was looking but then he opened his mouth again. He mentioned a partner and she wanted to crack some of her joints, this was the guy she'd be dealing with it seemed.

"[color=brown]I'm the only one who lives here. If you're my partner then come in, sit down at the table, and don't friggin move or I will ensure you join a society of eunuchs very, very soon.[/color]" Nui said as she turned away from the door leaving it open for the man to come through. She walked toward her room as she grumbled to herself that she was beginning to have a decent day too. As she went into her room she pulled the towel off before using her heel to kick the door closed, using the towel to finish drying herself off.

It wasn't long before she grabbed a change of clothes and threw them on, the set looking like most of her average attire. She didn't bother with her vest as she settled for the just the low cut pants and crop top, leaving her feet bare she she opened the door while walking back out into the common area of her apartment as she was tying her hair back into a ponytail that barely tickled past her shoulders.

"[color=brown]Who are you and why shou-Stop staring at my tits![/color]" Nui almost growled as she turned and headed toward her fridge. She opened it up and pulled out a can and popped the top before taking a chug from it. If Tokaido bothered to look he'd see the can was a brand of beer. "[color=brown]Let me guess, you're some deities gift to women? At least that's what you think or want to think. Am I right?[/color]" She asked as she leaned against her fridge after closing the door and stared at this guy in front of her.

			Tokaido's face lit up when she said that she was his partner, his day had just gotten a whole lot better. [color=#090]"haha, dont mind if I do."[/color] He said as he walked into the house and sat down at the table, paying her threat no mind. He would win this fight yet, she was fiesty but that just made it so much more interesting. He couldn't believe that they decided to put him with a female Chuunin, let alone one as attractive as this girl was. it was like a dream come true to Tokaido.

As she walked back to the kitchen, he couldn't help but stare at her breasts as they bounced. Unfortunately, she didn't seem to take kindly to that. [color=#090]"Hey hey, lighten up a little, i can't help but admire a great girl when i see one."[/color] He noticed her grab a beer out of the fridge, and couldn't help but attempt to impress. [color=#090]"mind if i grab one? a couple friendly beers between us will help to talk about business. I hate to be too serious, especially with such a pretty face. And as for me being a gift to women...well thats not really for me to say, i'm not a woman. I think i'll leave you to make that deduction for me."[/color] He couldn't say for sure, but he thought he could see at least a little bit of interest in this womans expression. it was obvious to see she was an alpha, but he'd win this fight yet.

			"[color=brown]You still haven't told me who you are.[/color]" She threw out before she took a swig from the can in her hand. This fool was a little too familiar with her, especially without earning that right. When he asked for a beer she looked at the can in her hand then shifted her gaze back to him with a rather incredulous look. "[color=brown]You haven't earn it. The beer in my fridge is reserved for people who've earned my respect, drunk me under the table, or managed to earn their place in my bed. You fall under none of those categories.[/color]"

There must have been a reason they partnered her with this guy, maybe it was to make her focus all her 'attitude' toward this man instead of the genin. If that was their plan, it was gonna work quite well. "[color=brown]Now, what do you know about this team?[/color]" Nui asked as she finished the beer and tossed the can into the nearby trashcan. It had been full yesterday but Jin must have done some cleaning. It would explain why there were no more dishes stacked in the sink, dirty clothes strewn about the floor, and various other things. She hated when he played house maid for her since it usually meant she'd try and pay him back somehow.

"[color=brown]And what are you capable of? I don't mean that in some stupid flirting fashion either. I'm talking combat skills, the capabilities that helped make you a CHuunin.[/color]" If she was gonna be paired with this fool, she'd need to know what he was capable of at least. That way she could find out if she was gonna be depriving the village of a useful tool or a bumbling idiot when she inevitably snapped and stabbed him in the neck from his wandering eyes. Most other men she's met were at least subtle about it.

			[color=#090]"Of course, how rude of me. Hideyoshi Tokaido."[/color] Tokaido had forgotten his formalities, which wasn't very like him. It was like something else was catching his attention. She denied him the beer, and it seemed she was pretty straight forward about it, though he still made a sly look at her conditions for respect.[color=#090]"And it will all come in due time, we've only just met."[/color]

Tokaido pondered why they would ever knowingly pair him with a Female chuunin. Just about every guy that knows him knows he's a bit of a playboy. Though he wasn't complaining about it. [color=#090]"I don't know anymore then you do, the only thing they told me was to show up here to talk to a partner about training some genin."[/color] Tokaido seriously didn't have a clue about why he was here, or why they specifically asked for him to do this, but it wasn't as though he could go against his orders.

[color=#090]"Well, I'm an expert in ranged combat specializing in multiple manners of throwing weapons. I earned the nickname Farshot in the academy, so i excel at long range shots. And how about yourself? What are you capable of?" [/color] He wanted to make an extra comment about specifics of her "capabilities" but he didn't want to risk it, she didn't seem to like the comments too much.

			'[i][color=brown]That explains why they partnered him with me. Fucking village and their making 'functional' teams and shit.[/color][/i]' She wanted to make a comment about his stupid nickname and long shots about him earning her respect but he might take that as an invitation to try, or worse that a long shot was better than no shot. Maybe if she just said she was a lesbian he'd give up. Then she realized that she'd be working with this guy and he'd try and see the girlfriend and then probably try for a three way.

She decided to focus on explaining her own skills just to get it over with since he didn't seem to know much about this team the village was shoving into her life. "[color=brown]Ishiguro Nui, no nickname or silly moniker of any kind. I use Denjiton, Sensor abilities, and Taijutsu. I specialize in hit and run tactics mostly. Good money says we have some stupid mid range jutsu user on the team or maybe a medic or something.[/color]" Nui crossed her arms under her chest as she huffed, looking away from the other Chuunin.

She never liked the way the village coddled the genin so much. Then again, if they were putting her on a team with a genin then maybe there was hope for the people in charge. Then again, maybe they're hoping she's changed her ideas on teaching but she was hoping they weren't that stupid.

			Tokaido couldn't help but keep a smile on his face the entire time she was talking. It was just something about her, probably her attitude towards him, that made him happy. It was as if his charm and good looks weren't doing anything for him, and as weird as that was it was also incredibly fun, he'd never met a girl immune to his silver tongue. A girl like this takes kinder to action, not words, so he'd need to step up his game a bit, while not being overly outgoing.

[color=#090]"A great name like yours doesn't need a nickname. but on a more serious note, if we are to be working together it's imperative we spar sometime. I could always use practice with someone fast enough to use hit and run tactics, it's pretty hard to hit someone that fast with a kunai knife."[/color] as he pulled one of his own kunai out and twirled it around in his hand, he seriously thought about that for a moment. If this girl was fast enough to fight hand to hand, as an ishiguro no less, she must have some incredible speed. It would be nigh impossible for Tokaido to accurately get a shot on her if she was expecting it.

He was liking this team so far, getting to work with someone like this was a great training experience, in more ways then one. If the rest of the team was like this, he wouldn't have any problem going on missions with this team for weeks at a time. The thought was almost enough to make his eyes roll back.

			She wanted to punch him, there was just that nagging sensation at the back of her mind like some kind of devil was sitting on her shoulder telling her to do it. Just ball up her fist and slam it into his jaw. But that might hurt her too and she didn't have nearly enough room to maneuver within her apartment to try and take him down. Then again she was fast and might be able to out maneuver him.

Then she realized it would make a huge mess in her place and she didn't want to deal with the hassle of cleaning it up, especially after Jin just cleaned it too. In the end, laziness won out and she stayed her hand as she felt her eye twitch for an instance. "[color=brown]Heh, I doubt you'd be able to hit me on a training field and if you take that as a challenge to throw something at me now, I will chop your balls off and shove them up your ass. This place just got cleaned and you are not throwing shit in my home. If you want me to kick your ass so bad then when we 'train' I'll freely kick your ass into next week.[/color]"

Nui was wondering if the rest of this team would be a group she could actually stand, hopefully they would be more subtle than Mr. Testosterone. That was it! That was a the perfect nickname for this pair of walking genitals. "[color=brown]So now the question becomes why the hell the village wanted us to meet before the entire team got together. I'm assuming they were hoping we'd kill each other off or something. Well, that's a little absurd, more like I'd have to kill you if anything.[/color]"

Then she realized it would make a huge mess in her place and she didn't want to deal with the hassle of cleaning it up, especially after Jin just cleaned it too. In the end, laziness won out and she stayed her hand as she felt her eye twitch for an instance. "[color=brown]Heh, I doubt you'd be able to hit me on a training field and if you take that as a challenge to throw something at me now, I will chop your balls off and shove them up your ass. This place just got cleaned and you are not throwing shit in my home. If you want me to kick your ass so bad then when we 'train' I'll freely kick your ass into next week.[/color]"

Nui was wondering if the rest of this team would be a group she could actually stand, hopefully they would be more subtle than Mr. Testosterone. That was it! That was a the perfect nickname for this pair of walking genitals. "[color=brown]So now the question becomes why the hell the village wanted us to meet before the entire team got together. I'm assuming they were hoping we'd kill each other off or something. Well, that's a little absurd, more like I'd have to kill you if anything.[/color]"

			This woman just hated Tokaido's guts more than anyone else ever had, but thats what kept him interested. He didn't know how she fought, but he could guess in order to hit and run you'd need space to do so, and inside of a house... probably not the best place to try that. But more importantly, he didn't want to wreck her house, as it was easy to see it was just recently cleaned.

[color=#090]"Haha, I would never throw something in someone else's house unless they told me otherwise, that's just plain disrespectful.

And the genital mutilation I could live without thanks. But I would love to train with you sometime, see how your body moves and such... for combat of course."[/color] Tokaido added the last part in order to hopefully avoid the wrath of this Ishiguro with an anger management problem.

[color=#090]"And to answer your question, I think we are the most experienced members of the team they are creating. If that's the case, they may have expected us to take over and lead the team. Other then that, the only thing i can think of is i was blessed by some higher power to meet you in private, because i'd never kill you, hahaha."[/color]

			'[i][color=brown]I can't say the same, I'm very tempted to harm you.[/color][/i]' Nui thought to herself as she wanted this guy out of her apartment. She knew kicking him out was not gonna work, nor would telling him to leave. Although, she still needed to get the paperwork concerning this new team from the village to know what their purpose would be since the team was mostly higher ranks with a genin or two thrown in. "[color=brown]Yeah well your ass kicking is gonna wait, I've gotta head out and you're not staying in my place while I'm gone.[/color]"

Nui walked back into her room, grabbing her jacket and sandals as she slipped them on. Walking back out she motioned for the door. "[color=brown]That means get out.[/color]" The female chuunin was also gonna ask why she was paired with this basket case. She could understand the complimenting skill sets, but he was more likely to get stabbed by her than the enemy. If she wasn't so sure that she would get in trouble for it, she would jam something pointy into him too.

"[color=brown]Fucking village and their god damn teams. Why can't I be on the team of drunks?[/color]" She mumbled to herself as she grabbed her keys from her room and headed for the door to her apartment.

			Tokaido got the foreboding feeling that Nui didn't want him around her right now. He could take a hint when he wanted to, but part of him wanted to go with her to talk about their team. [color=#090]"I understand you probably don't care very much for me, but still, a team is a team. I'd like to learn a bit about our team as well, why don't i come with you and we converse a bit about ourselves, try to make this "Getting Along" thing work."[/color]

This was Tokaido's last attempt, if she was really insistent about getting away from him, forcing himself onto her would probably result in alot of pain. He thought she was beautiful, but he could only get so close before he found a fist in his stomach, or worse. [color=#090]"You can't lie though, someone as fast as you makes the perfect cover for someone who needs to line up a shot like me. Maybe that's what the village had in mind, our abilities complement each other perfectly."[/color] Tokaido's expression was a bit more serious than he was when he originally arrived, he had put aside the fact that she was a woman at this point, for now at least.

			'[i][color=brown]Wait, did he just get serious for a second there? Holy shit, it's a miracle.[/color][/i]' Nui thought to herself as she was practically shoving him out the door. She closed it and locked it, slipping the key into her pocket before she looked at Tokaido. "[color=brown]Getting along depends more on how much you wanna keep hitting on me without earning some respect. To me you're no different than the guys in the bar that try to hit on me. I usually drink those lightweights under the table and go home to get myself off because very few prove themselves to be worth my time. And you're just like so far, all talk without earning your keep.[/color]"

Nui started down the hall as she pulled a pack of cigarettes out and light one up, flipping the lid on her engraved Ishiguro lighter closed as she looked back at Tokaido. "[color=brown]It will take more than sweet talk on me, and I doubt you can out drink me. Which means you're gonna have to earn my respect the hard way.[/color]" Nui said as her final say on the matter before she walked down the stairs off the complex.

I usually drink those lightweights under the table and go home to get myself off because very few prove themselves to be worth my time. And you're just like so far, all talk without earning your keep.[/color]"

Nui started down the hall as she pulled a pack of cigarettes out and light one up, flipping the lid on her engraved Ishiguro lighter closed as she looked back at Tokaido. "[color=brown]It will take more than sweet talk on me, and I doubt you can out drink me. Which means you're gonna have to earn my respect the hard way.[/color]" Nui said as her final say on the matter before she walked down the stairs off the complex.

			[color=#090]"Let me just say you're the only girl i've ever met that's completely immune to my charm. Most of the time I can hear their hearts pounding as I swoon them, but not you, you're different. I'll ease up on the hitting for now, but this isn't over."[/color] Tokaido decided to give her some space for now. Better to leave now and devise a strategy for this catch then stay and risk fumbling what chance he had left. This battle was lost, but now that he knew what he was up against, the war was sure to be an interesting sight. He left down the complex stairs, then went in the opposite direction of Nui, to go back to his house and think about his game-plan.

			Now, of course you can just track topics with the track topic buttom, but that can get clouded with multiple, so you just have to keep your active topics here.  Now, here you can keep all the topics that you've been in with each character.  You can format it however you like, but make sure you have it so you can keep track.

This will help you out if you need to make sure you have enough topics for a rank up. <o/

- is completely opposed to alcohol use by himself or anyone he's close to

- talented artist (ink style?)

- ADD, always has to be doing something. (Trouble on stakeout missions?)

- Lady's Man (raped love/ child arc idea?)(Special Jounin)

[b]Hideyoshi, Tokaido[/b]

“Farshot”

[throwing weapons and women… what else do I need?]

[b]General Information[/b]

[b]Age:[/b] 19

[b]Gender:[/b] Male

[b]Height:[/b] 6’1 feet

[b]Weight:[/b] 160 pounds

[b]Hair:[/b] Tokaido’s hair is black and usually kept in a ponytail about 6 inches long, with his bangs coming down on the sides and a part going down the middle of his scalp.

[b]Eyes:[/b] His eyes are bright green, and change between easygoing and sharp based on his personality.

[b]Physical Features:[/b] Tokaido’s body is reasonably toned, but not incredibly muscular. He bears quite a few scars on his body, mainly from training and messing up with his weapons. His most notable feature is his eyes, being very bright green they catch a lot of attention, and his largest scar goes across his left eye diagonally, from eyebrow to cheek.

[b]Clothing/Accessories:[/b] Tokaido’s mission outfit is pretty simple compared to most. He wears a black vest with a sleeveless black shirt underneath, form-fitting dark red pants, and a belt with 2 different shuriken holster positioned on the front of it. Two pouches hangs from the sides of his hips, each filled with his throwing weapons and tags. He also wears a pair of black boots that end at the bottom of the shin. Outside of missions, he usually tries to wear nice looking clothing, in order to look good for the ladies. This can range from formal dress clothing to a simple shirt and pants outfit, depending on where he’s located.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] Tokaido wears it on his right arm, around the bicep.

[b]Personality:[/b] Tokaido is a ladies man, pure and simple. He loves being around women, and uses his “loner” style to help him along the way. He is incredibly charming, quick to compliment, and a silver tongued devil when it comes to anything having to do with women. He goes out of his way to attempt to impress them, and very rarely does he take “no” for an answer, and even if he does, he’ll try again later.

Outside of the womanizing, Tokaido is actually a pretty sweet guy. He cares about most everyone he knows, and he’s generally friendly towards everyone. The only exception to this is when he’s on a mission or something serious. When this happens, his entire persona changes to that of a truly serious ninja, and puts mission success above all else, even his own life. He prefers not to mention this to others, because he doesn’t particularly like this side of himself, but he understands its necessity.

40x shuriken kept in 2 separate holsters on the front of his belt, each holding 20.

40x Kunai kept in a pouch on his right hip

10 exploding tags and 5 flash tags kept in a separate pocket in the pouch on his left hip

[b]Combat Style:[/b] Tokaido is an expert at throwing weapons. shuriken, kunai and Makibishi are his standard weaponry.

His specialty is long distance shots, and he makes them with surprising accuracy. He uses Flawless aim for ranged combat, and relies on Raiton techniques for close range combat and defense.

Flawless Aim: This is a style of weaponry skills long favored by specialists in ranged weapons. Users of this style focus on their eyes and hands, trying as best they can to achieve perfect synergy between their ability to analyze information and their ability to act on it.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b]

[b]Jutsu:[/b]

Flawless AimShow *[color=indigo][b]Rotation Shot[/b][/color]

D-Rank Taijutsu

The user has perfected the art of adding spiral on the release of a thrown projectile, increasing the distance and accuracy of such attacks. Throws made using Rotation Shot are considered +1 Strength solely for the purpose of determining range.

*[color=indigo][b]Sighting[/b][/color]

D-Rank Taijutsu

[b]Prerequisite:[/b] Wit 4

After many hours of training with ranged weaponry, the user is much better able to estimate distances and track moving targets in hectic situations. Such assessments become completely instinctive, allowing the user to change targets seemlessly without losing time between attacks. This technique forms the basis for many of the other techniques in this style.

*[color=indigo][b]Dangerous Position[/b][/color]

D-Rank Taijutsu

[b]Prerequisite:[/b] Taijutsu 4

The difference between combat and training is danger and unpredictability. The user of this technique is experienced at loosing weapons from positions other than a set stance, maintaining offense even while acting on the defense or recovering from a fall. Such attacks are made at full Strength and accuracy.

*[color=indigo][b]Prediction Shot[/b][/color]

C-Rank Taijutsu

[b]Prerequisite:[/b] Sighting

Relying on the ability to discern distance and track targets, the user makes a ranged attack on a moving target. Assuming that the target's speed and direction remain the same, shots made with this technique "lead" the correct amount to almost certainly strike true.

*[color=indigo][b]Bursting Shot[/b][/color]

C-Rank Nintaijutsu

The user performs the necessary handseals, channeling chakra into a projectile weapon as they draw it. The weapon flies normally, though it will appear to glow faintly with visible chakra. Upon impact, any damage the ranged attack would normally inflict is augmented with the force of 1.5 exploding tags.
TaijutsuShow [b]*Ambidexterity[/b]

D - Ranked Taijutsu

Requires: 5 Taijutsu

After extensive practice and training the character has gained equal strength and skill between their two hands. This allows them to perform any action with either hand at exactly the same skill level and strength.

[b]*Skillful Wield[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: 3 wit

With a solid foundation of knowledge on their choice of weaponry, those with the Skillful Wield technique are able to utilize their weapon more fully. By knowing the weapon's weakest points, the user is able to avoid presenting these areas to damage during combat, thus making their weapon less likely to break by means of recklessness.

[b]*Seamless Skill[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: 3 wit

A skill utilized by those on the path to mastery of their weapon, users of Seamless Skill are actively able to transition between offensive and defensive usage of the aforementioned weapon. By transitioning so seamlessly, the user is able to save a marginal amount of energy while attacking.

[b]*Shadow Shuriken Technique[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: User must possess shuriken of some variation

With little to its application, this technique requires the user to have at least two shuriken to use. When throwing the shuriken at the opponent, the user will throw another that will travel beneath the first, concealing itself within its shadow. By doing so, this allows the second shuriken to go undetected as it makes its approach toward the target. Both shuriken travel at a speed dictated by the user's strength stat unless stated otherwise.
RaitonShow [b][color=#fe0]*[Raiton • Clone][/color][/b]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After the user does the needed hand seals, a clone, lacking substance and the ability to interact with its environment, will form. These clones are destroyed after coming into contact with any physical object. As these clones have no free will, they are unable to do more than mimic the user's movements. However, unlike normal clones, these are filled with Raiton chakra. Whenever they disperse, they create a small blast of Raiton chakra in 1 meter in each direction causing slight shocks and numbness. The clone has the following stats:
Taijutsu: 1
Stamina: 1
Strength: 1
Speed: 1

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element• Shock Treatment][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the proper hand seals, the user's hands become electrically charged and they are able to use small currents of electricity to wake up someone who was knocked out. To add to this, these charges can stimulate the brain of someone who's conscious. This stimulation can wake those drifting to sleep or momentarily get rid of any grogginess caused by fatigue for four posts. This jutsu can’t bring targets out of genjutsu, however nor can it add wit.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Ground Spike Technique][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing a string of hand seals and stomping on the ground, the user emits five bolts of lightning in a line. Each bolt is two yards apart from the one before it (giving the jutsu a total range of ten yards from the user), rising 3 feet into the air from the ground in succession, starting from the farthest one with a speed equal to the user's control with a maximum of six. These bolts are pure energy; they aren’t solid so they aren’t effective in stopping objects. The shock created by the jutsu, however, causes the targets body to jerk and sends a mild pain equivalent to getting stabbed in the hand throughout the body for a brief second. This technique isn’t very devastating, but it’s useful in stopping charging enemies.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Thunder Blade][/color]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

The user generates a length of arching electricity, up to five feet long, from their fist after performing the necessary hand seals. This 'blade' of lightning can strike a single enemy once, leaving behind a pain as bad as a shallow stab to the area of impact. The impact also cause minor first and second degree electrical burns. If something comes between the 'blade' and the user it will disrupt the jutsu, ending it prematurely. If this blade isn’t used or destroyed, it stays together for up to 6 posts.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Electric Wire Technique][/color]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

The user creates a wire of electricity between their hands. This wire can be placed between two objects, like two trees or two rocks that are up to 10 meters apart. The user has to touch one of the objects and then drag the Raiton wire to the other object and attach it there. Upon being touched, the wire can trip targets while also delivering a painful shock to the limb that touched it, followed by paralysis to said limb. The paralysis lasts for one post, and the wire can sustain itself for up to 4 posts or until dismissed.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Elephant Fist][/color]

B-Rank Ninjutsu

By performing some hand seals and focusing Raiton chakra into their fist, causing it to spark and crackle, the user can greatly amplify the power of one punch. Once the user delivers a punch with the hand that this jutsu was used on, the Raiton will suddenly rush forwards into the targets body. This creates a blast with a power that pushes the target back at least ten feet if they have less than seven strength. The punch also causes the area it hit to go numb for another three posts, limiting the targets mobility with said limb.

[b]History[/b]

Tokaido Hideyoshi was born 19 years ago to an average family with no real notoriety. his mother died shortly after birth, so his father raised Tokaido by himself. Growing up as a child, Tokaido's life was much like every other kids. He had a few friends here and there, but for some reason he always had more female friends than male. His father always told him he would grow up to be a heartbreaker, but at the time he had no idea what that meant. When he was 4, Tokaido was accidently caught in the sights of an academy student's kunai knife, heading straight for his head. Out of complete reaction, he caught the blade and threw it back with unerring accuracy, striking the boy in his leg. While he was punished for injuring the boy by his father, this event was the moment when he realized his life's calling: Becoming a ninja.

He entered the academy at age 5, and at first was kind of shunned for having no innate talent or recognition. When it came to throwing weapon training though, everything changed. His accuracy was uncanny for a new student, and he quickly earned the respect of his classmates, outdoing everyone else by a wide margin in weapon throwing. He then knew that throwing weapons were to be his specialty. After growing up a bit, around the age of 10, he quickly started to realize that many of the female academy students had crushes on him. He decided to roll with it, and from then on, his charm and charisma won the heart of just about any girl he wanted. His father was slightly concerned with this, thinking maybe it was a means of coping with not having a mother, but he was mainly proud of his son for being great with the girls. Tokaido graduated from the academy at the age of 13, with slightly below average grades, due to his newfound "skill" with girls taking up most of his study time.

After becoming a Genin, Tokaido was a bit more full of himself, especially when it came to women. He took his missions very seriously though, to a point that most people didn't even recognize him. He realized this quickly, but for some reason couldn't change it. it was like an alternate personality would come out whenever a situation turned serious. At first he hated it, he felt like he wasn't himself, and it put a stop to his romance for a time while he found himself. After a lot of thought, he finally deduced that this "other side" was his method of suppressing his normal attitude in favor of a more serious one, for the purposes of doing his job. While he still didn't truly like it, he grew to accept it, though he still hides it from people if possible. After completing various Genin missions and spending a few years practicing his methods, he entered the Chuunin exams with a Female Ishiguro. They passed on their first try with flying colors, proving to be adept both as a team and individually. Tokaido became a Chuunin at the age of 18, just before his 19th birthday.

Tokaido spent alot more time with the girls after he became a chuunin, becoming a total womanizer at this point. He became so confident in himself that he would challenge himself to get a different girl to be with him every night. He never actually slept with the girls he womanized though, and is still a virgin to this day. His only real drive in life nowadays is hitting on pretty women and improving his ninja abilities.

[b]Hideyoshi, Tokaido[/b]

“Farshot”

[throwing weapons and women… what else do I need?]

[b]General Information[/b]

[b]Age:[/b] 19

[b]Gender:[/b] Male

[b]Height:[/b] 6’1 feet

[b]Weight:[/b] 160 pounds

[b]Hair:[/b] Tokaido’s hair is black and usually kept in a ponytail about 6 inches long, with his bangs coming down on the sides and a part going down the middle of his scalp.

[b]Eyes:[/b] His eyes are bright green, and change between easygoing and sharp based on his personality.

[b]Physical Features:[/b] Tokaido’s body is reasonably toned, but not incredibly muscular. He bears quite a few scars on his body, mainly from training and messing up with his weapons. His most notable feature is his eyes, being very bright green they catch a lot of attention, and his largest scar goes across his left eye diagonally, from eyebrow to cheek.

[b]Clothing/Accessories:[/b] Tokaido’s mission outfit is pretty simple compared to most. He wears a black vest with a sleeveless black shirt underneath, form-fitting dark red pants, and a belt with 2 different shuriken holster positioned on the front of it. Two pouches hangs from the sides of his hips, each filled with his throwing weapons and tags. He also wears a pair of black boots that end at the bottom of the shin. Outside of missions, he usually tries to wear nice looking clothing, in order to look good for the ladies. This can range from formal dress clothing to a simple shirt and pants outfit, depending on where he’s located.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] Tokaido wears it on his right arm, around the bicep.

[b]Personality:[/b] Tokaido is a ladies man, pure and simple. He loves being around women, and uses his “loner” style to help him along the way. He is incredibly charming, quick to compliment, and a silver tongued devil when it comes to anything having to do with women. He goes out of his way to attempt to impress them, and very rarely does he take “no” for an answer, and even if he does, he’ll try again later.

Outside of the womanizing, Tokaido is actually a pretty sweet guy. He cares about most everyone he knows, and he’s generally friendly towards everyone. The only exception to this is when he’s on a mission or something serious. When this happens, his entire persona changes to that of a truly serious ninja, and puts mission success above all else, even his own life. He prefers not to mention this to others, because he doesn’t particularly like this side of himself, but he understands its necessity.

Flawless Aim: This is a style of weaponry skills long favored by specialists in ranged weapons. Users of this style focus on their eyes and hands, trying as best they can to achieve perfect synergy between their ability to analyze information and their ability to act on it.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b]

[b]Jutsu:[/b]

Flawless AimShow *[color=indigo][b]Rotation Shot[/b][/color]

D-Rank Taijutsu

The user has perfected the art of adding spiral on the release of a thrown projectile, increasing the distance and accuracy of such attacks. Throws made using Rotation Shot are considered +1 Strength solely for the purpose of determining range.

*[color=indigo][b]Sighting[/b][/color]

D-Rank Taijutsu

[b]Prerequisite:[/b] Wit 4

After many hours of training with ranged weaponry, the user is much better able to estimate distances and track moving targets in hectic situations. Such assessments become completely instinctive, allowing the user to change targets seemlessly without losing time between attacks. This technique forms the basis for many of the other techniques in this style.

*[color=indigo][b]Dangerous Position[/b][/color]

D-Rank Taijutsu

[b]Prerequisite:[/b] Taijutsu 4

The difference between combat and training is danger and unpredictability. The user of this technique is experienced at loosing weapons from positions other than a set stance, maintaining offense even while acting on the defense or recovering from a fall. Such attacks are made at full Strength and accuracy.

*[color=indigo][b]Prediction Shot[/b][/color]

C-Rank Taijutsu

[b]Prerequisite:[/b] Sighting

Relying on the ability to discern distance and track targets, the user makes a ranged attack on a moving target. Assuming that the target's speed and direction remain the same, shots made with this technique "lead" the correct amount to almost certainly strike true.

*[color=indigo][b]Bursting Shot[/b][/color]

C-Rank Nintaijutsu

The user performs the necessary handseals, channeling chakra into a projectile weapon as they draw it. The weapon flies normally, though it will appear to glow faintly with visible chakra. Upon impact, any damage the ranged attack would normally inflict is augmented with the force of 1.5 exploding tags.
TaijutsuShow [b]*Ambidexterity[/b]

D - Ranked Taijutsu

Requires: 5 Taijutsu

After extensive practice and training the character has gained equal strength and skill between their two hands. This allows them to perform any action with either hand at exactly the same skill level and strength.

[b]*Skillful Wield[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: 3 wit

With a solid foundation of knowledge on their choice of weaponry, those with the Skillful Wield technique are able to utilize their weapon more fully. By knowing the weapon's weakest points, the user is able to avoid presenting these areas to damage during combat, thus making their weapon less likely to break by means of recklessness.

[b]*Seamless Skill[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: 3 wit

A skill utilized by those on the path to mastery of their weapon, users of Seamless Skill are actively able to transition between offensive and defensive usage of the aforementioned weapon. By transitioning so seamlessly, the user is able to save a marginal amount of energy while attacking.

[b]*Shadow Shuriken Technique[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: User must possess shuriken of some variation

With little to its application, this technique requires the user to have at least two shuriken to use. When throwing the shuriken at the opponent, the user will throw another that will travel beneath the first, concealing itself within its shadow. By doing so, this allows the second shuriken to go undetected as it makes its approach toward the target. Both shuriken travel at a speed dictated by the user's strength stat unless stated otherwise.
RaitonShow [b][color=#fe0]*[Raiton • Clone][/color][/b]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After the user does the needed hand seals, a clone, lacking substance and the ability to interact with its environment, will form. These clones are destroyed after coming into contact with any physical object. As these clones have no free will, they are unable to do more than mimic the user's movements. However, unlike normal clones, these are filled with Raiton chakra. Whenever they disperse, they create a small blast of Raiton chakra in 1 meter in each direction causing slight shocks and numbness. The clone has the following stats:
Taijutsu: 1
Stamina: 1
Strength: 1
Speed: 1

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element• Shock Treatment][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the proper hand seals, the user's hands become electrically charged and they are able to use small currents of electricity to wake up someone who was knocked out. To add to this, these charges can stimulate the brain of someone who's conscious. This stimulation can wake those drifting to sleep or momentarily get rid of any grogginess caused by fatigue for four posts. This jutsu can’t bring targets out of genjutsu, however nor can it add wit.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Ground Spike Technique][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing a string of hand seals and stomping on the ground, the user emits five bolts of lightning in a line. Each bolt is two yards apart from the one before it (giving the jutsu a total range of ten yards from the user), rising 3 feet into the air from the ground in succession, starting from the farthest one with a speed equal to the user's control with a maximum of six. These bolts are pure energy; they aren’t solid so they aren’t effective in stopping objects. The shock created by the jutsu, however, causes the targets body to jerk and sends a mild pain equivalent to getting stabbed in the hand throughout the body for a brief second. This technique isn’t very devastating, but it’s useful in stopping charging enemies.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Thunder Blade][/color]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

The user generates a length of arching electricity, up to five feet long, from their fist after performing the necessary hand seals. This 'blade' of lightning can strike a single enemy once, leaving behind a pain as bad as a shallow stab to the area of impact. The impact also cause minor first and second degree electrical burns. If something comes between the 'blade' and the user it will disrupt the jutsu, ending it prematurely. If this blade isn’t used or destroyed, it stays together for up to 6 posts.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Electric Wire Technique][/color]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

The user creates a wire of electricity between their hands. This wire can be placed between two objects, like two trees or two rocks that are up to 10 meters apart. The user has to touch one of the objects and then drag the Raiton wire to the other object and attach it there. Upon being touched, the wire can trip targets while also delivering a painful shock to the limb that touched it, followed by paralysis to said limb. The paralysis lasts for one post, and the wire can sustain itself for up to 4 posts or until dismissed.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Elephant Fist][/color]

B-Rank Ninjutsu

By performing some hand seals and focusing Raiton chakra into their fist, causing it to spark and crackle, the user can greatly amplify the power of one punch. Once the user delivers a punch with the hand that this jutsu was used on, the Raiton will suddenly rush forwards into the targets body. This creates a blast with a power that pushes the target back at least ten feet if they have less than seven strength. The punch also causes the area it hit to go numb for another three posts, limiting the targets mobility with said limb.

[b]History[/b]

Tokaido Hideyoshi was born 19 years ago to an average family with no real notoriety. his mother died shortly after birth, so his father raised Tokaido by himself. Growing up as a child, Tokaido's life was much like every other kids. He had a few friends here and there, but for some reason he always had more female friends than male. His father always told him he would grow up to be a heartbreaker, but at the time he had no idea what that meant. When he was 4, Tokaido was accidently caught in the sights of an academy student's kunai knife, heading straight for his head. Out of complete reaction, he caught the blade and threw it back with unerring accuracy, striking the boy in his leg. While he was punished for injuring the boy by his father, this event was the moment when he realized his life's calling: Becoming a ninja.

He entered the academy at age 5, and at first was kind of shunned for having no innate talent or recognition. When it came to throwing weapon training though, everything changed. His accuracy was uncanny for a new student, and he quickly earned the respect of his classmates, outdoing everyone else by a wide margin in weapon throwing. He then knew that throwing weapons were to be his specialty. After growing up a bit, around the age of 10, he quickly started to realize that many of the female academy students had crushes on him. He decided to roll with it, and from then on, his charm and charisma won the heart of just about any girl he wanted. His father was slightly concerned with this, thinking maybe it was a means of coping with not having a mother, but he was mainly proud of his son for being great with the girls. Tokaido graduated from the academy at the age of 13, with slightly below average grades, due to his newfound "skill" with girls taking up most of his study time.

After becoming a Genin, Tokaido was a bit more full of himself, especially when it came to women. He took his missions very seriously though, to a point that most people didn't even recognize him. He realized this quickly, but for some reason couldn't change it. it was like an alternate personality would come out whenever a situation turned serious. At first he hated it, he felt like he wasn't himself, and it put a stop to his romance for a time while he found himself. After a lot of thought, he finally deduced that this "other side" was his method of suppressing his normal attitude in favor of a more serious one, for the purposes of doing his job. While he still didn't truly like it, he grew to accept it, though he still hides it from people if possible. After completing various Genin missions and spending a few years practicing his methods, he entered the Chuunin exams with a Female Ishiguro. They passed on their first try with flying colors, proving to be adept both as a team and individually. Tokaido became a Chuunin at the age of 18, just before his 19th birthday.

Tokaido spent alot more time with the girls after he became a chuunin, becoming a total womanizer at this point. He became so confident in himself that he would challenge himself to get a different girl to be with him every night. He never actually slept with the girls he womanized though, and is still a virgin to this day. His only real drive in life nowadays is hitting on pretty women and improving his ninja abilities.

His accuracy was uncanny for a new student, and he quickly earned the respect of his classmates, outdoing everyone else by a wide margin in weapon throwing. He then knew that throwing weapons were to be his specialty. After growing up a bit, around the age of 10, he quickly started to realize that many of the female academy students had crushes on him. He decided to roll with it, and from then on, his charm and charisma won the heart of just about any girl he wanted. His father was slightly concerned with this, thinking maybe it was a means of coping with not having a mother, but he was mainly proud of his son for being great with the girls. Tokaido graduated from the academy at the age of 13, with slightly below average grades, due to his newfound "skill" with girls taking up most of his study time.

After becoming a Genin, Tokaido was a bit more full of himself, especially when it came to women. He took his missions very seriously though, to a point that most people didn't even recognize him. He realized this quickly, but for some reason couldn't change it. it was like an alternate personality would come out whenever a situation turned serious. At first he hated it, he felt like he wasn't himself, and it put a stop to his romance for a time while he found himself. After a lot of thought, he finally deduced that this "other side" was his method of suppressing his normal attitude in favor of a more serious one, for the purposes of doing his job. While he still didn't truly like it, he grew to accept it, though he still hides it from people if possible. After completing various Genin missions and spending a few years practicing his methods, he entered the Chuunin exams with a Female Ishiguro. They passed on their first try with flying colors, proving to be adept both as a team and individually. Tokaido became a Chuunin at the age of 18, just before his 19th birthday.

Tokaido spent alot more time with the girls after he became a chuunin, becoming a total womanizer at this point. He became so confident in himself that he would challenge himself to get a different girl to be with him every night. He never actually slept with the girls he womanized though, and is still a virgin to this day. His only real drive in life nowadays is hitting on pretty women and improving his ninja abilities.

Quote:[b]Combat Style:[/b] Tokaido is an expert at throwing weapons. shuriken, kunai and Makibishi are his standard weaponry.

His specialty is long distance shots, and his focus is sniping from a hidden area, then changing positions to confuse the enemy. He uses Flawless aim for ranged combat, and relies on Raiton techniques for close range combat and defense.

			Regardless of this being his primary ways of combat those numbers are astronomically big for the weapons.

30 shurikin, 20 kunai, and 30 makibishi would be about as much as you'd get at startup. Change the numbers and I won't take your 1/2.

			i removed the Makibishi, took the shuriken down to 40 (20 per holster with 2 holsters) and 30 kunai. will this suffice? if not i can take more kunai, but i'd really rather not lose many more shuriken unless i have to.

[“No matter what you do, do it with style”]

[b]General Information[/b]
[b]Age:[/b] 13

[b]Gender:[/b] Male

[b]Height:[/b] 5'6

[b]Weight:[/b] 130 Pounds

[b]Hair:[/b] Sanjuku's Hair is about 5 inches long, spiked to the back right side of his head, and black in color.

[b]Eyes:[/b] Sanjuku's eyes are emerald, appearing very sharp and refined.

[b]Physical Features:[/b] Sanjuku has a lean muscular frame, with traces of muscle definition usually showing through his regular clothing. He has broad shoulders and long legs, and smooth olive skin showing he takes his appearance seriously.

He has no scars on his body, as he prefers to have them all healed as best as possible to avoid "messing up his appearance".

[b]Clothing/Accessories:[/b] He normally wears a black sleeveless tank-top underneath a red jacket and a pair of baggy pants in matching color. The Symbol of Suna is sown into the back of his jacket. When not on missions he normally wears something akin to his mission outfit, the pants are usually a different color ranging from dark green to bright yellow and the tank top is always black. He usually doesn't wear his red jacket unless its cold or hes wearing his mission outfit. But he usually wears his Mission outfit whenever possible.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] He wears it on his head, like a normal ninja would.

[b]Personality:[/b] To put it simply, Sanjuku thinks he's top shit. He doesn't try to put anyone else down, but he's very prideful and full of himself. Some would even call him selfish, and that he cares only for himself, but anyone close to him knows he can be very loyal as a friend. He takes insulting remarks very poorly, but only if the person knows him, strangers words dont mean anything, Although he doesn't let on about this at all.

Sanjuku doesnt actively seek fights, but he isn't one to shirk away from one either. He prefers not to terribly injure someone unless he has to though. However, he is very protective of anyone he calls friend, and will quickly end the life of anyone endangering one, no questions asked. It isn't easy to impress Sanjuku, but doing so is a quick way to get on his good side, as he admires those with power. He is indifferent to people he hasn't met, giving everyone a fair chance to earn his respect, but rarely does he give anyone a second oppurtunity should they get on his bad side.

He wears a pair of bladed gauntlets, one on each arm. the blade starts along the outside of the forearm, just off the wrist, and continues past the elbow by a foot. The blades are each about 2 feet in length overall. The gauntlet itself is a fingerless kote made of black leather and lacquer, tying along the inside of the forearm. because it's fingerless and light, it doesn't interfere with handseal construction. The blades themselves are chakra sensitive and capable of being utilized in conjunction with ninjutsu.

[b]Combat Style:[/b] Sanjuku focuses on using his bladed gauntlets in combat, backed up by the slashing power of his fuuton techniques and the Ouji's time stop Doujutsu. He trains Taijutsu techniques revolved around using his elbows or punches to maximize the effectiveness of the blades.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b][b][color=gold][Todomeru Me [i][Freezing Eye][/i][/color][/b]

The Freezing Eye is the doujutsu of the Ouji clan. Whenever it isn't activated, nothing is different about the clan member, and all of their clan jutsu are sealed. Whenever activated, the eye of the clan member turns a light gold color and forms 72 black tick marks in the user's eye, with roman numerals at each hour mark. There are five ticks between each number, with a tick on each number, totalling 72 ticks. The ticker, which is easily seen and keeps track of the number of ticks that have been used up starts at 12 and makes it way around the eye in a clockwise manner. Once it hits 12 again, everything the clan member has stopped will become animated again, and the doujutsu will force the owner's eyes shut, as it changes back to a normal eye, sealing itself for 48 hours.

The ability to use the doujutsu is controlled by the user's control, and ninjutsu stats. Control is how well the user can stop an object, while the ninjutsu stat regulates how large of an object the clan member can stop. Additionally, all clan jutsu require stamina, just as every other ninjutsu.

The main prize of this doujutsu is the ability to 'stop time' which effectively is suspending a non-living, visible object in space. This is limited to non-living objects that aren't connected to a living object, meaning that clothing that is attached to someone is unaffected. Also, this goes in terms of all equipment, so people are treated as a singular object, with anything on their person being immune to the stop effects. However, a technique that has a prerequisite of 15 or higher is able to bypass this drawback. However, the jutsu will only work at 3/4ths of the user's control, rather than the full amount.

Todomeru Me jutsu go in the Ninpou pyramid.

FuutonShow [color=lightgreen]*Wind Element • Wind Screw[/color]

D-ranked Ninjutsu

After doing the needed hand seals, the user creates a small vortex of Fuuton chakra around a projectile in their hand. This creates a small drill bit which can be used to “drill” into whatever the object hits. It lasts for three posts or if the projectile is thrown, twenty yards from the user before dissipating. This doesn't make the projectile any faster, only increases its ability to cut.

[color=lightgreen]*Wind Element • Air Cushion[/color]

D-rank Ninjutsu

After forming a short string of hand seals, air will compact itself into a 4 meter radius "cushion" of sorts that is used to soften a fall from a great height. This won't prevent all damage but it will prevent major injury. It can be used up to twenty yards away from the user. It lasts until the end of the post it’s used in and dissipates after one use.

[color=lightgreen]*Wind Element • Guided Projectile[/color]

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Performing the needed hand-seals, the user can cover an object within three meters that is roughly the same size as a shuriken or kunai with a thin Fuuton shell that allows them to guide the object’s path in flight. With the shell, the user can change the direction of the object three times while it is in the air. The technique lasts for three posts or until all turns are used; in both cases the shell dissipates from around the object. If the object still has the shell when it hits it mark, it will pierce more easily, due to the Fuuton surrounding it. If the user goes more than ten meters away from the object in question, they will lose the ability to guide it.
TaijutsuShow[b]Elbow strike[/b]

D-rank Taijutsu

Sanjuku thrusts his elbow forward, balling his thrusting arm’s fist and pushing with the opposite hand to increase the thrust of the attack. When used with his bladed gauntlets this technique is even more effective, instead stabbing with the blade rather then impacting with the elbow.

[b]*Seamless Skill[/b]

D-Ranked Taijutsu

Prerequisite: 3 wit

A skill utilized by those on the path to mastery of their weapon, users of Seamless Skill are actively able to transition between offensive and defensive usage of the aforementioned weapon. By transitioning so seamlessly, the user is able to save a marginal amount of energy while attacking.

[b]History[/b]
Sanjuku’s life so far hasn’t been too far out of the ordinary. Born to the Ouji 13 years ago, Sanjuku’s mother and father took him home and everything was peaceful. At the age of 5, Sanjuku’s heart was set on doing what all Ouji want to do: become a great ninja and bring honor to the Ouji name. He did just this, enrolling in the academy at the same age as everyone else. His father was a Jounin in his days and was very proud of his son. He taught Sanjuku the ways of the Ouji clan’s Doujutsu and everything it could do, and it fascinated Him more than anything else.

It wasn’t until he joined the academy that he found his ability with the Ouji bloodline. He was a natural at it, impressing the other kids by suspending things in midair. He was the only Ouji in the academy, and that combined with the praise from the other kids contributed to his Full-of-himself personality. He was very self absorbed, but he had reason to be, proving to be one of the top students in the academy and acing every test or assignment that was given to him. He graduated at the age of 13, with almost straight A’s.

As a present from his father for graduation, he gave Sanjuku his Bladed Kote, a pair of ninja kote with chakra sensitive blades extending behind the elbow off the Wrist. Sanjuku wanted a weapon that would stand out, and they did just that, very few people had these. From then on they were his weapon of choice, although he hasn’t had a chance to really use them yet, being only a genin.

His goals in life are to become a master of the Time Stopping power he possesses. Being fresh out of the academy, he hasn't even been on his first mission. He dedicates most of his time to practicing his time stopping and fighting style. Overall, Sanjuku only wants one thing: to prove to himself that he is the best. And he’s willing to do anything to make that happen.

He usually doesn't wear his red jacket unless its cold or hes wearing his mission outfit. But he usually wears his Mission outfit whenever possible.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] He wears it on his head, like a normal ninja would.

[b]Personality:[/b] To put it simply, Sanjuku thinks he's top shit. He doesn't try to put anyone else down, but he's very prideful and full of himself. Some would even call him selfish, and that he cares only for himself, but anyone close to him knows he can be very loyal as a friend. He takes insulting remarks very poorly, but only if the person knows him, strangers words dont mean anything, Although he doesn't let on about this at all.

Sanjuku doesnt actively seek fights, but he isn't one to shirk away from one either. He prefers not to terribly injure someone unless he has to though. However, he is very protective of anyone he calls friend, and will quickly end the life of anyone endangering one, no questions asked. It isn't easy to impress Sanjuku, but doing so is a quick way to get on his good side, as he admires those with power. He is indifferent to people he hasn't met, giving everyone a fair chance to earn his respect, but rarely does he give anyone a second oppurtunity should they get on his bad side.

He wears a pair of bladed gauntlets, one on each arm. the blade starts along the outside of the forearm, just off the wrist, and continues past the elbow by a foot. The blades are each about 2 feet in length overall. The gauntlet itself is a fingerless kote made of black leather and lacquer, tying along the inside of the forearm. because it's fingerless and light, it doesn't interfere with handseal construction. The blades themselves are chakra sensitive and capable of being utilized in conjunction with ninjutsu.

[b]Combat Style:[/b] Sanjuku focuses on using his bladed gauntlets in combat, backed up by the slashing power of his fuuton techniques and the Ouji's time stop Doujutsu. He trains Taijutsu techniques revolved around using his elbows or punches to maximize the effectiveness of the blades.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b][b][color=gold][Todomeru Me [i][Freezing Eye][/i][/color][/b]

The Freezing Eye is the doujutsu of the Ouji clan. Whenever it isn't activated, nothing is different about the clan member, and all of their clan jutsu are sealed. Whenever activated, the eye of the clan member turns a light gold color and forms 72 black tick marks in the user's eye, with roman numerals at each hour mark. There are five ticks between each number, with a tick on each number, totalling 72 ticks. The ticker, which is easily seen and keeps track of the number of ticks that have been used up starts at 12 and makes it way around the eye in a clockwise manner. Once it hits 12 again, everything the clan member has stopped will become animated again, and the doujutsu will force the owner's eyes shut, as it changes back to a normal eye, sealing itself for 48 hours.

The ability to use the doujutsu is controlled by the user's control, and ninjutsu stats. Control is how well the user can stop an object, while the ninjutsu stat regulates how large of an object the clan member can stop. Additionally, all clan jutsu require stamina, just as every other ninjutsu.

The main prize of this doujutsu is the ability to 'stop time' which effectively is suspending a non-living, visible object in space. This is limited to non-living objects that aren't connected to a living object, meaning that clothing that is attached to someone is unaffected. Also, this goes in terms of all equipment, so people are treated as a singular object, with anything on their person being immune to the stop effects. However, a technique that has a prerequisite of 15 or higher is able to bypass this drawback. However, the jutsu will only work at 3/4ths of the user's control, rather than the full amount.

Todomeru Me jutsu go in the Ninpou pyramid.

FuutonShow [color=lightgreen]*Wind Element • Wind Screw[/color]

D-ranked Ninjutsu

After doing the needed hand seals, the user creates a small vortex of Fuuton chakra around a projectile in their hand. This creates a small drill bit which can be used to “drill” into whatever the object hits. It lasts for three posts or if the projectile is thrown, twenty yards from the user before dissipating. This doesn't make the projectile any faster, only increases its ability to cut.

[color=lightgreen]*Wind Element • Air Cushion[/color]

D-rank Ninjutsu

After forming a short string of hand seals, air will compact itself into a 4 meter radius "cushion" of sorts that is used to soften a fall from a great height. This won't prevent all damage but it will prevent major injury. It can be used up to twenty yards away from the user. It lasts until the end of the post it’s used in and dissipates after one use.

[color=lightgreen]*Wind Element • Guided Projectile[/color]

C-Ranked Ninjutsu

Performing the needed hand-seals, the user can cover an object within three meters that is roughly the same size as a shuriken or kunai with a thin Fuuton shell that allows them to guide the object’s path in flight. With the shell, the user can change the direction of the object three times while it is in the air. The technique lasts for three posts or until all turns are used; in both cases the shell dissipates from around the object. If the object still has the shell when it hits it mark, it will pierce more easily, due to the Fuuton surrounding it. If the user goes more than ten meters away from the object in question, they will lose the ability to guide it.
TaijutsuShow[b]Elbow strike[/b]

D-rank Taijutsu

Sanjuku thrusts his elbow forward, balling his thrusting arm’s fist and pushing with the opposite hand to increase the thrust of the attack. When used with his bladed gauntlets this technique is even more effective, instead stabbing with the blade rather then impacting with the elbow.

Prerequisite: 3 wit

A skill utilized by those on the path to mastery of their weapon, users of Seamless Skill are actively able to transition between offensive and defensive usage of the aforementioned weapon. By transitioning so seamlessly, the user is able to save a marginal amount of energy while attacking.

[b]History[/b]
Sanjuku’s life so far hasn’t been too far out of the ordinary. Born to the Ouji 13 years ago, Sanjuku’s mother and father took him home and everything was peaceful. At the age of 5, Sanjuku’s heart was set on doing what all Ouji want to do: become a great ninja and bring honor to the Ouji name. He did just this, enrolling in the academy at the same age as everyone else. His father was a Jounin in his days and was very proud of his son. He taught Sanjuku the ways of the Ouji clan’s Doujutsu and everything it could do, and it fascinated Him more than anything else.

It wasn’t until he joined the academy that he found his ability with the Ouji bloodline. He was a natural at it, impressing the other kids by suspending things in midair. He was the only Ouji in the academy, and that combined with the praise from the other kids contributed to his Full-of-himself personality. He was very self absorbed, but he had reason to be, proving to be one of the top students in the academy and acing every test or assignment that was given to him. He graduated at the age of 13, with almost straight A’s.

As a present from his father for graduation, he gave Sanjuku his Bladed Kote, a pair of ninja kote with chakra sensitive blades extending behind the elbow off the Wrist. Sanjuku wanted a weapon that would stand out, and they did just that, very few people had these. From then on they were his weapon of choice, although he hasn’t had a chance to really use them yet, being only a genin.

His goals in life are to become a master of the Time Stopping power he possesses. Being fresh out of the academy, he hasn't even been on his first mission. He dedicates most of his time to practicing his time stopping and fighting style. Overall, Sanjuku only wants one thing: to prove to himself that he is the best. And he’s willing to do anything to make that happen.

So did you just describe his every day or his mission outfit?  Please describe both instead of just 'average clothing'?

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but reverse bladed usually means it's sharp on the other side, so the sharpened side is against/towards his arm?  If not I'd recommended just saying "bladed gauntlets".

Other than these minor fixes, I don't see anything glaring.  I hope to rp with you soon. [i]

			aiight, fixed the appearance and clothing. also, by "reverse blade" i meant that the blade goes towards my elbow, not my fist. but i realize its pretty redundant, and since you understood what it is without the Reverse, i removed it.

			Requirements: Maximum average genjutsu. Minimum average wit. <- You need to update your stats according to this.

Forehead Protector: He doesn't wear it, but he carries it in the pouch on his left hip. <-- You should have this visible and not in pouch

After this, it should be ready for 1/2

			my stats are correct arent they? maximum average genjutsu = 3, and im not above that. minimum average wit =3, and thats what im at. am i misunderstanding? cus if so ill change it. also ill put the forehead protector on my head for once.

EDIT: i looked at other Ouji and there is a genin with the same gen and wit as me, so i don't think i should have to change it. however, i did lower my gen to 1 and put the point into my tai, making it 4.

			I'm not exactly sure what "MAXIMUM" average genjutsu is, but I doubt that the lowest stat possible for it is what they meant. I would recommend bumping it up to 3 (3 is average. No idea what MAXIMUM means though.)

			Maximum average genjutsu means that their maximum genjutsu score has to be the average for their rank.  They can have below, but not above.

[b]Mission Rank[/b]: C

[b]Hidden Village/Country Assigning Mission[/b]: Konohagakure no Sato

[b]Post Time Limit[/b]: 96 hours

[b]Detail[/b]: Apparently, some thugs invested some money in enlisting the services of a ninja. They were hardly on the radar before, but now they've gotten ambitious with some extra muscle on their side, and their territory is now just passed the Fire Country border. Go to our border with the Hot Spring Country and find out if there is a threat. If there is, neutralize it. Then, see if you can't get any information on whose bright idea it was to hire a ninja and take his group so close to us. The enemy shouldn't be very strong; we're not even sure where they got the funding to hire a ninja, let alone a good one.

[b]Pass[/b]: Eliminate the ninja threat.

[b]Additional Objectives:[/b] Get intel on who made the call to hire the ninja (1)

[b]Failure[/b]: you die; the threat isn't neutralized.[/url]

Making it to the border and asking around, it was easy to hear about this group. They had been just a small time ragtag bunch of crooks and thieves and hired swords and suddenly their territory jumped from one neighborhood to three whole towns! There were definitely whispers and rumors about a ninja, but nobody would be able to tell Kyuzo anything about if they were wearing a headband, or how he fought. He heard stories about stores that refused to pay protection money being set on fire, livestock slaughtered, there were even a couple of mysterious kidnappings that nobody could figure out.

Kyuzo's mission wasn't to stop them, though. He just needed to get rid of this mysterious new guy of theirs, whoever it was. The rest would hopefully sort itself out. Eventually, he found himself in the town where they had gotten their start, which now seemed half dead. Nobody was out for a walk in the humid afternoon. He was, for the moment, in a residential district of the town. Maybe he could find out something around here?

Good luck.

			Kyuzo walked through the desolate town in search of something he could use to ascertain the location of the thugs hideout. If he knew anything, the place where a group gets its start is usually their base of operations. The most effective way of locating the neighborhood where the group got started would obviously be to ask around, but since there wasn't anyone around, he started by simply walking through the various districts of the town, looking for someone who knew of the thugs group, perhaps someone who had been targeted such as a store clerk, or someone who looked to be a part of the group.

It was also important to note that Kyuzo was not wearing his normal all-black outfit, he wasn't dumb enough to walk in broad daylight wearing all black. His ninja apparel was in a backpack on his back. the only thing that might give him away is the pouch on his left side, but there wasn't anything out of the ordinary about it, just a normal looking fanny pack to the average person.

[also, feel free to let me know if and how i mess up so i can know what not to do, especially with post length.]

			(This post was fine. No worries at all. I'll give you a heads-up, though, that it's the job of the RP Mod to talk about the people and set the world and stuff.

You didn't do anything wrong here, I'm just letting you know because you're new that the words "Tried to" and "Attempted" and things of its kind will be your friend.)

As he walked, he'd be able to see people looking at him from out their windows, but once they caught his eye they would close their curtains quickly, wanting to avoid his attention. This was a fairly small town and he was a stranger here, and given their circumstances that meant that he was dangerous. Continuing his trip, however, he found himself int he business district. Some of the shops had closed, and at one point he passed the black, ashy rubble of what was probably once a general store. The shops didn't call out their wares to shoppers who were now few and far between, and instead sat quietly behind their bars, quietly hoping that business would come their way.

The important thing was, there were people here. The streets had a few shoppers getting things they needed, and not every shop was being kept, but there were people on the street, and that wasn't nothing.

			As Kyuzo arrived in the business district, and noticed all of the people around, he quickly analyzed everyone in the vicinity. realizing all he saw was a few shoppers and a few shopkeepers, he didn't feel anything was out of place. Now that he had located people, the next step is to actually talk to them. So he walked over to the nearest stall and attempted to talk to the keeper. If for some reason they didn't want to talk to him, due to his suspicious appearance, he would continue to the other stalls until he either got the info he wanted or attempted to talk to every shopkeeper he saw, all to no avail.

			It should have been noticed how quiet everybody was being.This town was small, but on a given day should have had twice the numbers of shoppers at least, and the retailers themselves would normally have been much more vocal. As he approached a shopkeeper, he would see fear in his face. Kyuzo was a stranger here, which meant he may have been dangerous. The shopkeep was a brave one, however, and chose to approach the counter. His voice was timid and full of care when he spoke.

			Kyuzo was callous to the unnerving quiet around the town, as quiet was something he was used to, being the kind of person to purposely separate himself from people to enjoy his solitude. nevertheless, he did understand that a quiet business district was obviously abnormal, and it wasn't hard to see that the people around him had a certain "feel" about them, as though they were all scared of something, be it the thugs or Kyuzo himself. It mattered little though, he didn't particularly care how they felt about him. Kyuzo's voice was as stoic as ever, but he tried his best to let his guard down, if only for a moment, and leaned on the counter by his elbows to show his hands, to let the man know he meant him no harm.

			The man's eyes darted one way to another, looking to be sure it was safe. He turned around back of him and reached up to the top of a shelf. He seemed to be a merchant of hunter's equipment. He pulled down a bear trap; he had to make it look like he was trying to make a sale.

[i]"I'm sorry, sir, but if I tell you too much they'll burn down the store! They're making every business here pay protection money, and I'm short for the month. . . So I'll tell you a little bit if you can help my business."[/i]

Whether he was just being a sly salesman or genuinely wanted to help but needed help himself would be hard to determine, but Kanjo would have the money to make the purchase if he wanted to. The bear trap [i]did[/i] seem to be a quality make, produced with sturdy steel and sharp, gripping teeth and a nice, hardy spring mechanism.

Or, he might be able to force some information out of the man, or bring someone out of hiding if he attacked. It wouldn't make the Leaf Village look good exactly, and he wouldn't be seen as a friend to this place, but it might get some results a bit faster.

			Kyuzo immediately realized what the man was doing before he did it, you can't openly talk about these sort of things. He also didn't care whether he was just trying to make his living or not, as long as the shopkeeper provided the information he required, Kyuzo was satisfied. So in order to make it seem a bit more realistic, and therefore avoid as much attention as possible, he agreed to buy the bear trap from the salesman. if nothing else he could find some sort of use for a trap, as long as it was sturdy and well made. Kyuzo paid for the trap and tucked it away in his pouch, then immediately started again. [color=#ffff00]"Now, calmly explain the situation."[/color]

			He nodded, making something of a show of taking the money and fiddling with the register, trying to make it look like he was just giving casual conversation to a customer rather than spilling vital information. What he was giving wouldn't be enough to call the mission a success, but it would give Kyuzo a nice start. [i]"The group was small time, until recently, when they hired a ninja. Then they started exploding. . . They've been calling themselves "The Vine," and I've never really heard of anybody by that name before... I think it might just be a bigger group that sort of took this one in!"[/i] he was speaking in a rushed whisper, and handed Kyuzo the bear trap. It would be big, but it had a slim chain and a hook, so he could attach it into hi shirt and carry it on his back if he liked.

[i]"I don't know if I can tell you much more, but they make us pay them to get protected from street thugs, and if we don't, they come and attack us themselves! The ninja around here has a sword he likes to threaten people with. Some of the people around here say he sliced an entire building in half!"[/i]

Kyuzo now had something to go on. What he did with it from there was up to him.

			Kyuzo took his leave without a word, his business with the clerk finished. Slinging the trap onto his back by the chain, he walked away from the clerk, but remained in the business district for the time being. [i][color=#ffff00]"If these people are supposed to "protect" the stores, the quickest method of drawing them out would be to cause a scene. I don't want to resort to that yet though..."[/color][/i]. As he pondered this quandary, Kyuzo began searching the town for anything that might turn him on to a hideout or location of some form. Specifically, he was looking for someone with a distinct sword, one that looked as though it could slice a building in two, as wild as the claim sounded.

(if this was too specific i'm sorry. its what he would search for at this point though.)

			(Not too specific at all. You have a lead and you're going with it. That's a good thing. I would remind you, though, that this is a ninja world, and your target is supposedly a ninja, so with the proper use of jutsu any sword has that potential.)

As Kyuzo walked, things would mostly seem normal, although he would notice some well-armed men passing buy now and then. He'd notice quickly that some of the passersby had swords. It stood to reason that these guys weren't friendly: in a place where terror was being used to control, the good guys wouldn't get weapons. There were four or five of them in the area, though, and none of them were wearing headbands. To take one on might mean taking all of them on, but it might also get him the information he needed without harming anybody.

None of them were wearing headband, but that didn't mean by definition that one of them wasn't the ninja.

			Nagisa had been reclining on a bench in a park, tree and the like all around to provide privacy. It was actually one of the best places to get some reading done, much like she was doing now. Sitting beside a path, the bench set next to a pair of small steps that led up a short embankment and often a haven of tress. In front of the bench there was a small clearing, a path passing in front of the bench, and plenty of trees around. All in all, it wasn't easily found unless you've traveled these paths before.

And as if on cue Nagisa shifted her gaze to someone who was jogging along the path. They didn't acknowledge her and kept going as she returned to reading. As they disappeared, the young Yamanaka felt a strange sensation. It was like a tossed up between someone watching you and hearing that twig snap in absolute silence when you were 100% sure no one was around for miles. She looked around and saw nothing and that made her worry a bit, she didn't like the idea of being out here alone all of a sudden.

Closing her eyes she concentrated and her mind reached out, like a pulse. It wove a path through the trees, under the bushes, and across the tree tops. Expanding out, it sent back a red flag right away. Someone was out there and not on the path. Nagisa was on her feet in an instant as she opened her mouth. "[color=coral]I know you're out there, show yourself![/color]"

To put the icing on the cake, she pointed in their direction and looking with a determination that masked her uneasiness.

			Nagisa had been reclining on a bench in a park, tree and the like all around to provide privacy. It was actually one of the best places to get some reading done, much like she was doing now. Sitting beside a path, the bench set next to a pair of small steps that led up a short embankment and often a haven of tress. In front of the bench there was a small clearing, a path passing in front of the bench, and plenty of trees around. All in all, it wasn't easily found unless you've traveled these paths before.

And as if on cue Nagisa shifted her gaze to someone who was jogging along the path. They didn't acknowledge her and kept going as she returned to reading. As they disappeared, the young Yamanaka felt a strange sensation. It was like a tossed up between someone watching you and hearing that twig snap in absolute silence when you were 100% sure no one was around for miles. She looked around and saw nothing and that made her worry a bit, she didn't like the idea of being out here alone all of a sudden.

Closing her eyes she concentrated and her mind reached out, like a pulse. It wove a path through the trees, under the bushes, and across the tree tops. Expanding out, it sent back a red flag right away. Someone was out there and not on the path. Nagisa was on her feet in an instant as she opened her mouth. "[color=coral]I know you're out there, show yourself![/color]"

To put the icing on the cake, she pointed in their direction and looking with a determination that masked her uneasiness.

			Kyuzo wandered through the trees of the park for what seemed like hours. He had roamed this particular area so many times he almost had the trees memorized. He roamed this area so frequently because of the lack of people in the area. normally people dont walk to far off the park paths, and with the exception of the benched area he was approaching, most people dont even come this far into the park. He noticed a jogger to his Left, but payed him no mind as he didnt notice Kyuzo at all.

As he approached the benched area, however, Kyuzo noticed a girl sitting on the bench at the bottom of the steps to the treeline he was wandering in. Just as he was about to turn around and go the other way to avoid notice, he heard the girl call him out. [color=#ffff00][i]"she's bluffing, she didnt notice me"[/i][/color] he thought, until she pointed directly at him through the treeline. Although he was shocked she found him, he walked out, cold-faced, and stared at her, unmoved. [color=#ffff00]"How did you spot me?"[/color] Kyuzo said after a long pause.

			The person who emerge from the trees was dress in black and looked like some kind of ninja from picture books one reads as a child. He seemed cold faced, almost frumpy, by the way that someone had found him. Even his statement voice frumpiness about being caught. "[color=coral]You honestly think a Sensor wouldn't pick you up? The only way you're gonna hide from me is if you're a better Sensor than me. Now why were you lurking about?[/color]"

Nagisa lowered her hand as she finished asking her question. It was a bit odd that someone would be wandering about in the woods and not running on the path. Then again maybe he was trying not to get laughed at for his attire. Hell it was out of place amongst the trees anyway, why he hadn't gotten some kind of camouflage was beyond her.

Still, she used her thumb to mark her place as she closed the book and awaited an answer from the man. "[color=coral]Also, what's with the get up?[/color]" She added, really wanting to know what was with the traditional picture book ninja looking get up.

			Kyuzo could tell the girl was not as weak as she appeared, despite her slender figure and simple clothing. And while he had heard of sensors, he knew little of what they actually were. Paying the woman's smartass tone and remarks about his attire no mind, he went back to what she said, being a sensor. [color=#ffff00]"what is a sensor? and it isn't against the law to wander off the paths."[/color]

As he said this, Kyuzo walked completely into the open and stood about 5 feet from the girl, noticing that with all the trees around, shadows werent an issue. From here he could see that the girl held an erotic novel of some sort. This was odd compared to what most girls spent their time reading, although he cared little. He stood motionless, waiting on the girl to answer his question and hopefully learn a thing or two to help him counteract this "sensor" he was speaking to.

			"[color=coral]No, but you're lurking like a creepy person. So you're either trying to accomplish some kind of training or you're just a creepy stalker person. Either way, still doesn't explain the outfit.[/color]" Nagisa said, motioning to his appearance once more. It was really distracting, especially out in the open. How could someone be sneaky in broad daylight? It seemed a bit odd if anything, more eye catching than camouflage.

"[color=coral]What is a sensor.....[/color]" Nagisa was having trouble not being a completely wiseass at that moment. So many things she could say but this person didn't seem the type to take those kinds of comments with a grain of salt.

"[color=coral]No, but you're lurking like a creepy person. So you're either trying to accomplish some kind of training or you're just a creepy stalker person. Either way, still doesn't explain the outfit.[/color]" Nagisa said, motioning to his appearance once more. It was really distracting, especially out in the open. How could someone be sneaky in broad daylight? It seemed a bit odd if anything, more eye catching than camouflage.

"[color=coral]What is a sensor.....[/color]" Nagisa was having trouble not being a completely wiseass at that moment. So many things she could say but this person didn't seem the type to take those kinds of comments with a grain of salt. "[color=coral]Well Frumpy, a sensor is someone who can sense the chakra signature of others. Mind's Eye sensors like me can pick you up from long distances away. Make for good tracking and recon.

			[color=#ffff00]"sensing chakra signatures..."[/color] Kyuzo couldn't believe he overlooked this. While he could hide himself very well from sight and sound, He'd never thought about his Chakra. If this average looking girl saw him coming, he'd stand no chance against more skilled sensors. [color=#ffff00]"this outfit is my everyday attire, its meant for night, not day. But that's not important." [/color]

As Kyuzo pondered the question of hiding from the Mind's eye, he came to a quick realization. rather then ponder these questions with no knowledge of how these techniques work, it would be much more beneficial to learn how it works from someone who is actually trained in the style. [color=#ffff00]"Where there are ways to detect someone, there are ways to hide from it. Is there a way to hide my Chakra signature?" [/color]

As he waited for his reply, Kyuzo noticed the woman's unease at his presence. He was used to this feeling, but he didn't want to spook her, thus ending his information gathering. So he took a seat on the bench in order to drop the tension and relax things a bit.

Its something every ninja should take seriously." [/color] Kyuzo bluntly said before standing up and starting to walk away. This girl was somewhat helpful in pointing out his flaws at least, but that helped little. Still, the girl wasn't completely useless, he had to at least give her that.

[color=#ffff00] "you were... somewhat helpful. I wander the woods because I prefer the solitude, and I was lurking to improve upon my skills in stealth.

He could tell this girl could still help him, perhaps with training or even a method of subverting or at least identifying Sensors. While he didnt care for social interaction, a partner to train with is a better way to gauge one's ability.

			'[i][color=coral]Wow, this guy is a little too serious about his job. I almost wanna see if there's a tree branch poking out of his ass or something.[/color][/i]' As the young man stood and started moving away form the bench, Nagisa remained quite to hear what he had to say since he started talking again. When it was an explanation on his lurking she almost wanted to nod. She wasn't gonna argue, the solitude made it a nice place for her to read, would explain why he'd wander in the woods for a little training.

As he stated his intent to train and his desire to train, Nagisa took a moment to think on it. She wondered what he could do with training with her, Sensor techniques weren't about who would block or attack better, it was about honing your 6th sense to track down someone. Then again if he wanted to learn how they worked she could just explain it to him... to the best of her abilities that is.

"[color=coral]Yamanaka Nagisa.... So you want to learn about sensors or learn to be a sensor? Cause I'm not sure how training with me would work for you. I could track you down if you were trying to be stealthy normally like today, but unless you try to become a sensor, then good luck trying to subvert one. I've never heard of a way to do it without being a sensor yourself.[/color]"

'[i][color=coral]Wow, this guy is a little too serious about his job. I almost wanna see if there's a tree branch poking out of his ass or something.[/color][/i]' As the young man stood and started moving away form the bench, Nagisa remained quite to hear what he had to say since he started talking again. When it was an explanation on his lurking she almost wanted to nod. She wasn't gonna argue, the solitude made it a nice place for her to read, would explain why he'd wander in the woods for a little training.

As he stated his intent to train and his desire to train, Nagisa took a moment to think on it. She wondered what he could do with training with her, Sensor techniques weren't about who would block or attack better, it was about honing your 6th sense to track down someone. Then again if he wanted to learn how they worked she could just explain it to him... to the best of her abilities that is.

"[color=coral]Yamanaka Nagisa.... So you want to learn about sensors or learn to be a sensor? Cause I'm not sure how training with me would work for you. I could track you down if you were trying to be stealthy normally like today, but unless you try to become a sensor, then good luck trying to subvert one. I've never heard of a way to do it without being a sensor yourself.[/color]"

			[color=#ffff00]"Learning Sensor Jutsu would be helpful to someone trying to avoid detection. We could learn much from each other."[/color] Kyuzo said as he approached Nagisa again, his interest rekindled. [color=#ffff00]"Stealth is only one of my weapons, I have much more than that." [/color] He didn't want to admit it, but he needed someone to train with, and this girl fit the role well.

[color=#ffff00]"You would be one of the few people I train with, as I prefer that my techniques stay relatively unheard of for personal reasons. I usually train by myself, but that only goes so far." [/color] Kyuzo felt a growing discomfort in the pit of his stomach. He hated admitting he actually needed someone for once, even though its human nature to do so. Nevertheless, since she hadn't already left he knew that she was at least somewhat interested.

[color=#ffff00]"it's up to you." [/color] He said as he stood like a stone awaiting his answer.

It's not like normal training so you'll have to be prepared for a long bout of training. We won't be able to get to that today, I've got my wall patrol coming up.[/color]" Nagisa wondered how she'd be able to contact him again, but then she recalled he said his name was Nara. Someone at the compound would know how to pass a message along to him.

"[color=coral]Still, no reason we can't plan out this upcoming training.

She had been trained by another Yamanaka so they compared it to their clan techniques which helped her grasp onto it a hell of a lot easier, but she had no idea how well Kyuzo would fair.

"[color=coral]I'm not entirely sure what else to recommend before training. I mean, I know how I can instruct you a little easier when the time comes, but I suppose there's not much else that can be done without actually attempting the training first. Oh, do you have any questions that I can answer?[/color]" Nagisa asked, pondering what else she could do to help.... then she wondered why she was helping him learn Sensor jutsu. This guy wasn't exactly the friendly sort, but then her Aunt's voice would kick in saying 'it's the polite thing' or some other bullshit like that.

Maybe she was just looking for something new to do with her time. Maybe she was looking for an excuse to train her own sensor abilities, who knew?

			Kyuzo paused for a moment, not sure of what to ask, or if he could ask anything at all. without a proper grip on the subject, he knew very little of the details of Mind's Eye Sensor techniques, making it hard to not sound like an idiot when talking about them. [color=#ffff00]"Your Yamanaka, so i assume you are generally better at using your mind and chakra together. Sensory jutsu should come more naturally to you then to others. It will be more challenging for me to learn, but I don't mind the challenge if its useful to know."[/color]

He didn't care how easy or hard it would be, he couldn't allow someone else to be able to sense him in this way. It completely destroyed his methods of remaining anonymous and unseen. His shadow couldn't even hide him from that kind of scouting. [color=#ffff00]"My only question is how does learning how to sense someone teach me how to prevent myself from being sensed?" [/color] Kyuzo said as he wondered how masking chakra would work in the first place. It wasn't as easy as hiding on a roof or in a bush. Still though, maybe he could reverse engineer the technique or something.

At the end of the day though, it doesn't matter. Being able to sense an oncoming enemy would help Kyuzo better prepare his hiding spots, and that was enough for him to want to learn Mind's eye Sensory Jutsu.

			'[i][color=coral]Talk about commitment. Still if he wants to learn, maybe it can help me train my own sensor abilities at the same time. Teaching someone is the best way to test your own abilities, I may even learn a thing or two myself.[/color][/i]' Nagisa thought to herself as she thought on when she had free next. "[color=coral]I recall having a day off next week from patrol duties and missions, Wednesday if I recall. When is you next free day, we might be able to begin training sooner rather than later.[/color]"

Kyuzo brought up the question about masking his aura. It wasn't hard to reply to, especially since she'd done it before in this conversation. "[color=coral]Like I said, you suppress your chakra signature. Only the more skilled sensors are capable of it, I recall hearing it's an A rank jutsu too. Honestly, it'll be like flexing a muscle in time, it's not too hard to use Mind's Eye when you get the hang of it. Plus it can let you gather different types of info in various ways.[/color]"

"[color=coral]But I can explain Sensor stuff in more detail on our training day, so when do you have free next?[/color]" nagisa asked, getting a little antsy it would seem, mostly because she hadn't had a chance to train her sensor abilities in a while and this would be the best chance she'd have for a long time.

'[i][color=coral]Talk about commitment. Still if he wants to learn, maybe it can help me train my own sensor abilities at the same time.

With that she turned, heading off down the path to return to the buildings and streets of Konoha so she could get to her village duties.

[“In the shadows of the night, the unseen blade is the deadliest”]

[b]General Information[/b]

[b]Age:[/b] 16

[b]Gender:[/b] Male

[b]Height:[/b] 6'0

[b]Weight:[/b] 185 Pounds

[b]Hair:[/b] Kyuzo's pitch black hair is kept short, barely concealing his scalp.

[b]Eyes:[/b] thin eyes with small pupils, blue in color.

[b]Physical Features:[/b] Kyuzo's body is very muscular. In order to fulfill the physical demands of his occupation, he keeps his body in great condition. His only scars are under his clothing, all wounds from various weapons.  His most notable feature, his eyes, are bright blue with a sharp, penetrating stare that offsets most people.

[b]Clothing/Accessories:[/b] His normal clothing is as black as cloth can be, in order to remain unseen at night. This is essentially a standard japanese ninja outfit, including a mask and soft sole shoes to conceal sound, with black pants, a form fitting long sleeved top, gloves, and a belt with shuriken holders and pouches for carrying various tools in. The Konoha village symbols are on the back of his gloves, and the Nara clan symbol is on his back, both in a dull red color to prevent much notice. He does carry a change of normal everyday clothing to blend in during the day.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] Carries it in his ninja pouch

[b]Personality:[/b] Kyuzo is almost mechanical, showing almost no emotion, and speaking only when its needed. He is always aware of his surrounding, and ready for any situation to turn deadly. He has absolutely no qualms over killing someone, but he wont kill without purpose. He strives to be a perfectionist in everything he does, and it shows in his features and ability. When others would panic or quake, Kyuzo is always calm and collected, as if nothing phases him. Kyuzo is very professional in his work, doing very little outside of the required mission. He will do anything to accomplish a mission or objective, but because of this, these are all that matter to him. Outside of his missions, his only concern is furthering his own training.

Due to his stealthy methods, Kyuzo attempts to keep everyones positions in mind at all times, and rarely does he ever let anyone behind him. If someone does get behind him, he will not hesitate to begin fighting right then and there. This paranoia keeps him constantly vigilant. He tends to be by himself often, as he prefers it, and only goes with others if he is required to, or he feels they are useful to him. While he is by no means an outcast, he simply has no interest in a social life with no reason. He's perfectly willing to train or work with someone if he feels they are on his level, if not they are completely disregarded or dealt with if they become a nuisance.

Ninjato,2 1/2 foot long blade with a 6 inch handle, overall 3 feet, positioned on right hip for an underhand draw

Binoculars with a zoom of about 500 meters in pouch

[b]Combat Style:[/b] Kyuzo focuses on a stealthier approach, the fewer people who know hes there the better. He uses his shadow jutsu to suppress enemies and hide from vision, and his skill in tai allows him to pass silently. His most preferred method of killing is his shadow blade, but Kyuzo can use anything as a weapon if needed.

[b]Jutsu Information[/b]
[b]Abilities:[/b]

[b]Shadow Manipulation[/b]

Less of an element and more like a specialty, the members of the Nara Clan are able to manipulate both their own shadows and shadows in the surrounding area in ways that normal ninja are not able to due to their 'shadow chakra'. This chakra allows them to use various techniques that allow them to create effective traps to use against an opponent as long as there is enough light in the area to create the shadows needed to do so. If there is absolutely no light present in the area of the Nara member, they are unable to use their shadow techniques. Unfortunately, because the shadows produced by clones is not the same as those made by humans, clones cannot utilize shadow binding techniques.

[b]Jutsu:[/b] Shadow TechsShow

[b]~Shadow Kunai[/b]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra the user will cause a shadow on their body to move toward their hand, forming into a solid kunai when it reaches their hand. The kunai is just like any other kunai in terms of durability and sharpness, but cannot be thrown, and lasts for up to three posts.

[b]~Shadow Tendril[/b]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause their shadow to rise up off the ground in the form of a single tendril, about three inches in diameter. The tendril can be manipulated with a strength of 3 and a speed equal to the user's control up to 6. This technique may be held for a number of posts equal to the user's stamina with a maximum of six before reverting back into the normal shadows. The shadows can move out to a max of 10 meters without the use of other shadows.

[b]~Shadow Projectile Counter[/b]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: ~Shadow Tendril, 6 tai

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause their shadow to rise up out of the ground in the form of a tendril. They will then have the tendril catch an incoming projectile. So long as the projectile was thrown at a speed less than [Control+Taijutsu]/2, it may be caught. The tendril will then flick the weapon back at the opponent at a speed of three.

[b]~Shadow Walking[/b]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user is able to raise it off of the ground, if only slightly, causing it to become solid. This creates a sort of platform to walk on, but only where the user's foot would land, making it quite efficient. This lasts for up to three posts, and can go no more than one inch off of the ground.

[b]~Static Shadow Imitation[/b]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will send their shadow out at a speed equal to their control to a max of 8 toward the target, aiming to connect the target's shadow with their own. If successful, the opponent will be trapped, only able to make the same movements as the user. This lasts for a number of posts equal to half the user's stamina, and can be broken out of if the target has at least 5 strength. The shadow, unaided, can stretch up to 10 meters, but can use up to 6 other shadows to move through.

[b]~Shadow Transportation[/b]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

After adding the needed hand seals onto either Shadow Sewing or Shadow Stitch, the user will cause the tendril to shoot out and latch onto something before contracting, either pulling the item toward the user at a strength of 5, or pulling the user toward it at a speed of 6, depending on the resisting force of the object.

[b]~Shadow Skin[/b]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause their shadow to crawl up their body, covering them from head to toe in a protective armor that is capable of resisting strikes of less than 4 strength. While using this technique, the user is unable to use other shadow jutsu, as this requires their full shadow. This may be held for a number of posts equal to the user's stamina with a maximum of 6, or until broken.

[b] Shadow Form  [/b]

B-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause their shadow to cover them from head to toe in shadow, making them difficult to see. To see the User, an enemy must have higher wit then the users Ninjutsu, to a cap of 7, otherwise the user remains unseen. This is not invisibility, the user cannot walk into plain view. this jutsu only makes the user harder to detect, and lasts for 3 posts.

[b]~Shadow Blade[/b]

B-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause the shadow to crawl up their body, eventually ending up in one of their hands, lengthening itself to form into the likeness of a sword, with a 2 foot blade and a six inch handle. The blade is as sharp as any normal blade, and lasts for a number of posts equal to the user's stamina up to 4.
Tai TechsShow

[b] Sneak [/b]

D-Rank Taijutsu

The user quiets their footsteps , but moves at half normal speed. Enemies must have an equal or higher wit vs the users tai to notice the user, otherwise the user remains unheard.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element• Shock Treatment][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the proper hand seals, the user's hands become electrically charged and they are able to use small currents of electricity to wake up someone who was knocked out. To add to this, these charges can stimulate the brain of someone who's conscious. This stimulation can wake those drifting to sleep or momentarily get rid of any grogginess caused by fatigue for four posts. This jutsu can’t bring targets out of genjutsu, however nor can it add wit.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Lightning Shock][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

This is a technique utilized by Raiton users to deliver a small but powerful shock to an opponent. By performing a short set of hand seals and focusing Raiton into his/her own hands, the user can wrap the appendages in electricity. For two posts, any direct contact between the user's hand and the target will send a shock through the target's body. The pain caused is equivalent to being stabbed by a senbon.

[color=#fe0] Lightning element • Shocking grasp [/color]

D-Rank ninjutsu

After forming the hand seals needed, the user will coat his hand in Raiton chakra while holding a weapon. He can transfer this chakra into the weapon, adding additional piercing power to the technique. This charge lasts for 3 posts and produes a small shock that creates a tingling, numbing sensation where it hits.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Lightning Cutter][/color]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: User must have a sword.

After completing a short set of hand seals the user will imbue their bladed weapon with electricity. Next he or she will swipe the air in front of them. The lightning stored in the blade will give the weapon an amplified swing, causing a 3 foot crescent shaped lightning bolt to fly towards the opponent within a five meter range. If the attack touches any part of the target’s body it will create a painful jolt that lasts a whole post. The jolt shocks the target every couple of seconds during the post and the pain each time is equivalent to getting stabbed in the hand. Upon impact with the target, the attack also causes some physical damage, creating an impact like a punch thrown by somebody with three strength.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Rifle Technique][/color]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

After completing a set of hand seals the user will either focus chakra into a bladed weapon or index finger. He/she then points his/her hand (or the tip of his/her weapon) at the target and fires off a bolt of lightning that travels out a max of five meters. The lightning bolt itself will only cause minor damage, but due to the speed of the attack the impact is more than enough to knock the air out of someone or send them backwards about five meters as if they had just been rammed into. The opponent can resist being knocked backwards if they have a strength stat that is at least equal to the user's control stat. The speed of this bolt is equal to the user's control stat with a max of 8.

[b]History[/b]
SpoilerShow Kyuzo was born on a moonless night, his father a Nara ninja who was killed in action 5 months after his mother became pregnant with him, and his mother died soon after childbirth. From that day through to his days at the academy, he was raised by Nara caregivers, and rarely spoken of except by his primary caregiver, Nara Ayame. She raised him as her own and told him the stories of his parents, which did little to the boys cold attitude towards everyone. Ayame always tried to get the boy to show just a little emotion, but he rarely did, the occasional smirk or chuckle was the most she could get from him.

It didn’t take long for Kyuzo to join the academy, he was naturally gifted and aced all of his exams. His classmates never talked to him or about him for fear of what may happen, the one person who tried to bully kyuzo got held outside a window by shadows until he wet himself. The children rarely had anything to do with him, which is exactly what he wanted. He developed a habit of using sleight of hand to swipe classmates pencils in order to start fights between classmates. This deception came naturally to Kyuzo, as did his stealthiness. He graduated the academy at the top of his class at the age of 13.

Kyuzo’s genin team was undesirable to say the least, a ditzy clumsy girl and an annoying Hyuuga boy that thought he was better then everyone because of his “heritage”. The Hyuuga would constantly jeer Kyuzo in an attempt to get some competition out of him, but it always ended in a stupid look followed by Kyuzo walking away shaking his head. He never understood the concept of competition, why should he prove hes the best? No, he knew what he was, he didn’t need to beat someone else to prove it.

As soon as he could, Kyuzo took the chuunin exams and quickly got away from those undesirables. Soon after becoming a chuunin, he developed more of his sneaky ability by hunting animals on foot with only a kunai. he has developed a callous disregard of emotion as a whole, feeling almost nothing at this point. He spends most of his time on the Nara grounds when not on missions, roaming the forests in silence, as he has always preferred it.

[“In the shadows of the night, the unseen blade is the deadliest”]

[b]General Information[/b]

[b]Age:[/b] 16

[b]Gender:[/b] Male

[b]Height:[/b] 6'0

[b]Weight:[/b] 185 Pounds

[b]Hair:[/b] Kyuzo's pitch black hair is kept short, barely concealing his scalp.

[b]Eyes:[/b] thin eyes with small pupils, blue in color.

[b]Physical Features:[/b] Kyuzo's body is very muscular. In order to fulfill the physical demands of his occupation, he keeps his body in great condition. His only scars are under his clothing, all wounds from various weapons.  His most notable feature, his eyes, are bright blue with a sharp, penetrating stare that offsets most people.

[b]Clothing/Accessories:[/b] His normal clothing is as black as cloth can be, in order to remain unseen at night. This is essentially a standard japanese ninja outfit, including a mask and soft sole shoes to conceal sound, with black pants, a form fitting long sleeved top, gloves, and a belt with shuriken holders and pouches for carrying various tools in. The Konoha village symbols are on the back of his gloves, and the Nara clan symbol is on his back, both in a dull red color to prevent much notice. He does carry a change of normal everyday clothing to blend in during the day.

[b]Forehead Protector:[/b] Carries it in his ninja pouch

[b]Personality:[/b] Kyuzo is almost mechanical, showing almost no emotion, and speaking only when its needed. He is always aware of his surrounding, and ready for any situation to turn deadly. He has absolutely no qualms over killing someone, but he wont kill without purpose. He strives to be a perfectionist in everything he does, and it shows in his features and ability. When others would panic or quake, Kyuzo is always calm and collected, as if nothing phases him. Kyuzo is very professional in his work, doing very little outside of the required mission. He will do anything to accomplish a mission or objective, but because of this, these are all that matter to him. Outside of his missions, his only concern is furthering his own training.

Due to his stealthy methods, Kyuzo attempts to keep everyones positions in mind at all times, and rarely does he ever let anyone behind him. If someone does get behind him, he will not hesitate to begin fighting right then and there. This paranoia keeps him constantly vigilant. He tends to be by himself often, as he prefers it, and only goes with others if he is required to, or he feels they are useful to him. While he is by no means an outcast, he simply has no interest in a social life with no reason. He's perfectly willing to train or work with someone if he feels they are on his level, if not they are completely disregarded or dealt with if they become a nuisance.

[b]Abilities:[/b]

[b]Shadow Manipulation[/b]

Less of an element and more like a specialty, the members of the Nara Clan are able to manipulate both their own shadows and shadows in the surrounding area in ways that normal ninja are not able to due to their 'shadow chakra'. This chakra allows them to use various techniques that allow them to create effective traps to use against an opponent as long as there is enough light in the area to create the shadows needed to do so. If there is absolutely no light present in the area of the Nara member, they are unable to use their shadow techniques. Unfortunately, because the shadows produced by clones is not the same as those made by humans, clones cannot utilize shadow binding techniques.

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause their shadow to rise up off the ground in the form of a single tendril, about three inches in diameter.

This chakra allows them to use various techniques that allow them to create effective traps to use against an opponent as long as there is enough light in the area to create the shadows needed to do so. If there is absolutely no light present in the area of the Nara member, they are unable to use their shadow techniques. Unfortunately, because the shadows produced by clones is not the same as those made by humans, clones cannot utilize shadow binding techniques.

[b]Jutsu:[/b] Shadow TechsShow

[b]~Shadow Kunai[/b]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra the user will cause a shadow on their body to move toward their hand, forming into a solid kunai when it reaches their hand. The kunai is just like any other kunai in terms of durability and sharpness, but cannot be thrown, and lasts for up to three posts.

[b]~Shadow Tendril[/b]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause their shadow to rise up off the ground in the form of a single tendril, about three inches in diameter. The tendril can be manipulated with a strength of 3 and a speed equal to the user's control up to 6. This technique may be held for a number of posts equal to the user's stamina with a maximum of six before reverting back into the normal shadows. The shadows can move out to a max of 10 meters without the use of other shadows.

[b]~Shadow Projectile Counter[/b]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: ~Shadow Tendril, 6 tai

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause their shadow to rise up out of the ground in the form of a tendril. They will then have the tendril catch an incoming projectile. So long as the projectile was thrown at a speed less than [Control+Taijutsu]/2, it may be caught. The tendril will then flick the weapon back at the opponent at a speed of three.

[b]~Shadow Walking[/b]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user is able to raise it off of the ground, if only slightly, causing it to become solid. This creates a sort of platform to walk on, but only where the user's foot would land, making it quite efficient. This lasts for up to three posts, and can go no more than one inch off of the ground.

[b]~Static Shadow Imitation[/b]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will send their shadow out at a speed equal to their control to a max of 8 toward the target, aiming to connect the target's shadow with their own. If successful, the opponent will be trapped, only able to make the same movements as the user. This lasts for a number of posts equal to half the user's stamina, and can be broken out of if the target has at least 5 strength. The shadow, unaided, can stretch up to 10 meters, but can use up to 6 other shadows to move through.

[b]~Shadow Transportation[/b]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

After adding the needed hand seals onto either Shadow Sewing or Shadow Stitch, the user will cause the tendril to shoot out and latch onto something before contracting, either pulling the item toward the user at a strength of 5, or pulling the user toward it at a speed of 6, depending on the resisting force of the object.

[b]~Shadow Skin[/b]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause their shadow to crawl up their body, covering them from head to toe in a protective armor that is capable of resisting strikes of less than 4 strength. While using this technique, the user is unable to use other shadow jutsu, as this requires their full shadow. This may be held for a number of posts equal to the user's stamina with a maximum of 6, or until broken.

[b] Shadow Form  [/b]

B-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause their shadow to cover them from head to toe in shadow, making them difficult to see. To see the User, an enemy must have higher wit then the users Ninjutsu, to a cap of 7, otherwise the user remains unseen. This is not invisibility, the user cannot walk into plain view. this jutsu only makes the user harder to detect, and lasts for 3 posts.

[b]~Shadow Blade[/b]

B-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause the shadow to crawl up their body, eventually ending up in one of their hands, lengthening itself to form into the likeness of a sword, with a 2 foot blade and a six inch handle. The blade is as sharp as any normal blade, and lasts for a number of posts equal to the user's stamina up to 4.
Tai TechsShow

[b] Sneak [/b]

D-Rank Taijutsu

The user quiets their footsteps , but moves at half normal speed. Enemies must have an equal or higher wit vs the users tai to notice the user, otherwise the user remains unheard.
Rai TechsShow
[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element• Shock Treatment][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

After performing the proper hand seals, the user's hands become electrically charged and they are able to use small currents of electricity to wake up someone who was knocked out. To add to this, these charges can stimulate the brain of someone who's conscious. This stimulation can wake those drifting to sleep or momentarily get rid of any grogginess caused by fatigue for four posts. This jutsu can’t bring targets out of genjutsu, however nor can it add wit.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Lightning Shock][/color]

D-Rank Ninjutsu

This is a technique utilized by Raiton users to deliver a small but powerful shock to an opponent. By performing a short set of hand seals and focusing Raiton into his/her own hands, the user can wrap the appendages in electricity. For two posts, any direct contact between the user's hand and the target will send a shock through the target's body. The pain caused is equivalent to being stabbed by a senbon.

[color=#fe0] Lightning element • Shocking grasp [/color]

D-Rank ninjutsu

After forming the hand seals needed, the user will coat his hand in Raiton chakra while holding a weapon. He can transfer this chakra into the weapon, adding additional piercing power to the technique. This charge lasts for 3 posts and produes a small shock that creates a tingling, numbing sensation where it hits.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Lightning Cutter][/color]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: User must have a sword.

After completing a short set of hand seals the user will imbue their bladed weapon with electricity. Next he or she will swipe the air in front of them. The lightning stored in the blade will give the weapon an amplified swing, causing a 3 foot crescent shaped lightning bolt to fly towards the opponent within a five meter range. If the attack touches any part of the target’s body it will create a painful jolt that lasts a whole post. The jolt shocks the target every couple of seconds during the post and the pain each time is equivalent to getting stabbed in the hand. Upon impact with the target, the attack also causes some physical damage, creating an impact like a punch thrown by somebody with three strength.

[color=#fe0]*[Lightning Element • Rifle Technique][/color]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

After completing a set of hand seals the user will either focus chakra into a bladed weapon or index finger. He/she then points his/her hand (or the tip of his/her weapon) at the target and fires off a bolt of lightning that travels out a max of five meters. The lightning bolt itself will only cause minor damage, but due to the speed of the attack the impact is more than enough to knock the air out of someone or send them backwards about five meters as if they had just been rammed into. The opponent can resist being knocked backwards if they have a strength stat that is at least equal to the user's control stat. The speed of this bolt is equal to the user's control stat with a max of 8.

[b]History[/b]
SpoilerShow Kyuzo was born on a moonless night, his father a Nara ninja who was killed in action 5 months after his mother became pregnant with him, and his mother died soon after childbirth. From that day through to his days at the academy, he was raised by Nara caregivers, and rarely spoken of except by his primary caregiver, Nara Ayame. She raised him as her own and told him the stories of his parents, which did little to the boys cold attitude towards everyone. Ayame always tried to get the boy to show just a little emotion, but he rarely did, the occasional smirk or chuckle was the most she could get from him.

It didn’t take long for Kyuzo to join the academy, he was naturally gifted and aced all of his exams. His classmates never talked to him or about him for fear of what may happen, the one person who tried to bully kyuzo got held outside a window by shadows until he wet himself. The children rarely had anything to do with him, which is exactly what he wanted. He developed a habit of using sleight of hand to swipe classmates pencils in order to start fights between classmates. This deception came naturally to Kyuzo, as did his stealthiness. He graduated the academy at the top of his class at the age of 13.

Kyuzo’s genin team was undesirable to say the least, a ditzy clumsy girl and an annoying Hyuuga boy that thought he was better then everyone because of his “heritage”. The Hyuuga would constantly jeer Kyuzo in an attempt to get some competition out of him, but it always ended in a stupid look followed by Kyuzo walking away shaking his head. He never understood the concept of competition, why should he prove hes the best? No, he knew what he was, he didn’t need to beat someone else to prove it.

As soon as he could, Kyuzo took the chuunin exams and quickly got away from those undesirables. Soon after becoming a chuunin, he developed more of his sneaky ability by hunting animals on foot with only a kunai. he has developed a callous disregard of emotion as a whole, feeling almost nothing at this point. He spends most of his time on the Nara grounds when not on missions, roaming the forests in silence, as he has always preferred it.

			Oreo wanted me to check this, just a heads up all you mods before you get on me about this post.

Weight: 185 <- need to include the unit of measurement

Some capitalization things you could fix under his appearance, clothing, and personality.

[b]Shadow Form[/b]

B-Rank Ninjutsu

After forming the needed hand seals and flooding their shadow with chakra, the user will cause their shadow to cover them from head to toe in shadow, making them difficult to see. To see the user, an enemy must have higher wit then the user's ninjutsu, otherwise the user is unseen.

It'd be the opponents wit vs your ninjutsu to a cap, maybe 7 at B rank I'll leave that to a mod to determine. Also you need to state how long this lasts.

*[Lightning Element • Lightning Cutter]

C-Rank Ninjutsu

Prerequisite: User must have a sword.

You need a sword, but that shouldn't be a problem. Just add a Ninjato to Kyuzo and he'd be good to go. When/If you do add the Ninjato, be sure to add the weapon specs and where it's kept as well.

I have no problem with the history minus him graduating at 11 years old. But again, I'll leave that to a proper mod to handle.

			You need to mention clan trait eyes and pupils either in the eye category or in the physical traits category

I'd like to see a little more on personality~  Remember, when you want to RP with people that is the main section they're going to look at

Weapons are a bit easier to read like this

x40 Shuriken on blah blah

x3 Flash tags held in a bag on blah blah

And we also need measurements on the Ninjato and zoom quality of the binoculars

On one mission, kyuzo watched as the Hyuuga thought he was tough enough to handle an enemy ninja by himself. The enemy immediately stabbed him through the heart without even trying, and subsequently charged into kyuzo’s kunai, positioned to stab through the throat. <-------------------- not going to happen on a genin mission, really I'd save that for maybe a chuunin mission

Also, Konoha OOC here you'll need to be careful.  Konoha isn't really into the whole killing things for fun and all that.  Act too ridiculous/crazy/bloodthirsty, not fun for your character xP

			alright, updated his eyes to reflect the Nara traits, but i was a little unfamiliar with "thin" eyes, i guess its like shikamaru's eyes, always almost closed? also updated his equipment, added a bit more depth to his personality, primarily his views on other people and his work, and removed the part in his history about the Hyuuga dying.

2 questions of clarification: does this mean that the Hyuuga i just made up out of the blue is going to interact with Kyuzo since hes not dead? i have no problem with this, i just didnt want to make an NPC or anything without permission.

also, Kyuzo isnt so much a bloodthirsty killer, more of a professional who takes his work very seriously. OOC i want him in the Root organization, specializing in assassination. how would Konoha view that?

			Haha no, you don't have to mention him at all...you don't have to make NPCs for stuff like that anyways.  I was just saying the chance of that happening on a genin mission is so slim, genin missions don't usually include combat

Also, that's fine, your character is fine as is it was more a warning to be careful about how you rp and appear to the village because yeah, seriousness is fine, cruelness isn't

1/2 (Don't post here unless you chance anything, PM me if you have any questions about Konoha stuffs)
